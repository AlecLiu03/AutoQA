To solve the question "what's 1+1?", I will follow a structured approach. 

1. **Reflect on the Question**: The question is straightforward and requires basic arithmetic. The operation involved is addition.

2. **Plan the Calculation**: 
   - I need to define the variables for the numbers involved in the addition.
   - The equation to solve is simply \(1 + 1\).

3. **Write the Code**: I will use the `sympy` library to perform the addition and print the result.

Now, I will write the code.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
a = 1
b = 1

# Perform the addition
solution = a + b

# Print the solution
print(solution)
``````
```output
2
```
The output of the code is 2, which makes sense as the sum of 1 and 1 is indeed 2.

Now, I will conclude the solution.

**Answer:** 2
