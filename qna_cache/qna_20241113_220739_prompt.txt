### Context:
\(\left(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{1}\right)\)

Multiply by the lowest common denominator, which in this case is 6, to obtain (2, 3, 6). The plane in Figure 1.6 is then referred to as the (236) plane. The integers are referred to as the Miller indices. We will refer to a general plane as the (hkl) plane.

### Comment

We can show that the same three Miller indices are obtained for any plane that is parallel to the one shown in Figure 1.6. Any parallel plane is entirely equivalent to any other.

**Objective:** Calculate the density of states per unit volume over a particular energy range. Consider the density of states for a free electron given by Equation (3.69). Calculate the density of states per unit volume with energies between 0 and 1 eV.

**EXAMPLE 3.3**
# Solution

The volume density of quantum states, from Equation (3.69), is

$$N = \int_0^{1 eV} g(E) \, dE = \frac{4 \pi (2m)^{3/2}}{h^3} \cdot \int_0^{1 eV} \sqrt{E} \, dE$$

or

$$N = \frac{4 \pi (2m)^{3/2}}{h^3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} E^{3/2}$$

The density of states is now

$$N = \frac{4 \pi [2(9.11 \times 10^{-31})]^{3/2}}{(6.625 \times 10^{-34})^3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^{3/2} = 4.5 \times 10^{21} \text{ m}^{-3}$$

or

$$N = 4.5 \times 10^{21} \text{ states/cm}^3$$

# Comment

The density of quantum states is typically a large number. An effective density of states in a semiconductor, as we will see in the following sections and in the next chapter, is also a large number but is usually less than the density of atoms in the semiconductor crystal.

# EXERCISE PROBLEM

Ex 3.3 For a free electron, calculate the density of quantum states (#/cm^3) over the energy range of (a) 0 ≤ E ≤ 2.0 eV and (b) 1 ≤ E ≤ 2 eV. [_{e.u.} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} J; _{e.u.} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} J; _{e.u.} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} J]

### Instruction:
Solve the following question:
What is 10^2*3?
By doing the following:
First, reflect on the question (without actually solving it or doing any math) and the context shown above and determine the correct approach/strategy to solving it.
Then, solve the question step by step. If you ever need to solve an equation or calculate the value of an expression, utilize function calling by writing sympy code. But before writing code, plan out what variables will be used and what equations/expressions will be solved, and what should be printed out.
When writing your code block, make sure to define all variables used and use print statements as variables won't be displayed automatically, ie, write ``print(solution)`` instead of ``solution``.
After you output code, I will go and run the code and report whatever is printed to console, like this:
```output
5```
Reflect upon the results and see if they make sense, and continue with the next step as needed. If there is an error, analyze the code and the error and think of ways to fix the error. Then output new code. If you fail to fix the error, think of an alternative way to solve the problem.
Note that after I run the code, I will wipe the memory. Therefor, previously defined symbols and variables will be erased and must be redefined in the next code block you write. For instance, if you found that m=5 in the last code block, you must redefine m=5 in the new code block you write.
Finally, after solving the problem, output "Answer:", followed by the answer.
