To solve the problem regarding the energy levels of an electron in an infinite potential well, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Reflect on the Question
The problem asks for the first three energy levels of an electron in an infinite potential well with a width of 10 Å. The formula for the energy levels in an infinite potential well is given by:

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2ma^2}
\]

where:
- \(E_n\) is the energy of the nth level,
- \(n\) is the principal quantum number (1, 2, 3, ...),
- \(a\) is the width of the well (10 Å),
- \(m\) is the mass of the electron,
- \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant.

### Step 2: Define Variables and Constants
We will need the following constants:
- Mass of the electron, \(m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\)
- Reduced Planck's constant, \(\hbar = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}\)
- Width of the well, \(a = 10 \, \text{Å} = 10 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)

### Step 3: Calculate the Energy Levels
We will calculate the first three energy levels (\(n = 1, 2, 3\)) using the formula provided.

### Step 4: Write the Code
Now, let's write the code to perform these calculations.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Constants
m = 9.109e-31  # mass of electron in kg
hbar = 1.055e-34  # reduced Planck's constant in Js
a = 10e-10  # width of the well in meters

# Quantum numbers
n_values = [1, 2, 3]

# Calculate energy levels
E_levels = [(n**2 * sp.pi**2 * hbar**2) / (2 * m * a**2) for n in n_values]

# Convert energy from Joules to eV (1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J)
E_levels_eV = [E / 1.60218e-19 for E in E_levels]

E_levels_eV
```
```output
```
It seems that the output did not return any values. Let's check the code for any issues and ensure that we are correctly calculating the energy levels.

### Review of the Code
1. **Constants**: The mass of the electron and reduced Planck's constant are correctly defined.
2. **Width of the Well**: The width is converted from Ångströms to meters correctly.
3. **Energy Calculation**: The formula for energy levels is applied correctly for \(n = 1, 2, 3\).
4. **Conversion to eV**: The conversion from Joules to eV is also correctly implemented.

### Debugging
To ensure that we get output, we will explicitly print the energy levels in eV. Let's modify the code to include print statements.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Constants
m = 9.109e-31  # mass of electron in kg
hbar = 1.055e-34  # reduced Planck's constant in Js
a = 10e-10  # width of the well in meters

# Quantum numbers
n_values = [1, 2, 3]

# Calculate energy levels
E_levels = [(n**2 * sp.pi**2 * hbar**2) / (2 * m * a**2) for n in n_values]

# Convert energy from Joules to eV (1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J)
E_levels_eV = [E / 1.60218e-19 for E in E_levels]

# Print the energy levels in eV
for n, E in zip(n_values, E_levels_eV):
    print(f"E_{n} = {E:.4f} eV")
```
```output
E_1 = 0.3764 eV
E_2 = 1.5054 eV
E_3 = 3.3872 eV
```
The calculated energy levels for the electron in an infinite potential well with a width of 10 Å are as follows:

- **First Energy Level (\(E_1\))**: 0.3764 eV
- **Second Energy Level (\(E_2\))**: 1.5054 eV
- **Third Energy Level (\(E_3\))**: 3.3872 eV

### Next Step: Photon Emission Calculation
Now, we need to determine the wavelength of a photon emitted when the electron transitions from the third energy level (\(E_3\)) to the second energy level (\(E_2\)). The energy of the emitted photon can be calculated using the formula:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = E_3 - E_2
\]

Once we have the energy of the photon, we can find its wavelength using the relation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{\text{photon}}}
\]

where:
- \(h\) is Planck's constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}\)),
- \(c\) is the speed of light (\(3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)).

### Write the Code for Photon Wavelength Calculation
Let's write the code to calculate the wavelength of the emitted photon.

```python
# Constants for photon calculation
h = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in Js
c = 3.00e8  # speed of light in m/s

# Energy difference for the photon emitted
E_photon = E_levels[n_values[2] - 1] - E_levels[n_values[1] - 1]  # E_3 - E_2

# Wavelength of the emitted photon
wavelength = h * c / E_photon  # in meters

# Convert wavelength to nanometers
wavelength_nm = wavelength * 1e9  # convert to nm

wavelength_nm
``````
```output

The error indicates that the variable `E_levels` is not defined in the current context. This is because the previous code block that defined `E_levels` was executed separately, and the variables were not retained in memory.

### Solution
We need to redefine all necessary variables and constants before calculating the wavelength of the emitted photon. Let's combine the previous calculations and the new calculations into one code block.

### Complete Code for Energy Levels and Photon Wavelength Calculation
Here’s the complete code that calculates the energy levels and then computes the wavelength of the emitted photon when transitioning from \(E_3\) to \(E_2\):

```python
import sympy as sp

# Constants
m = 9.109e-31  # mass of electron in kg
hbar = 1.055e-34  # reduced Planck's constant in Js
a = 10e-10  # width of the well in meters

# Quantum numbers
n_values = [1, 2, 3]

# Calculate energy levels
E_levels = [(n**2 * sp.pi**2 * hbar**2) / (2 * m * a**2) for n in n_values]

# Convert energy from Joules to eV (1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J)
E_levels_eV = [E / 1.60218e-19 for E in E_levels]

# Constants for photon calculation
h = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in Js
c = 3.00e8  # speed of light in m/s

# Energy difference for the photon emitted
E_photon = E_levels[n_values[2] - 1] - E_levels[n_values[1] - 1]  # E_3 - E_2

# Wavelength of the emitted photon
wavelength = h * c / E_photon  # in meters

# Convert wavelength to nanometers
wavelength_nm = wavelength * 1e9  # convert to nm

# Print the wavelength of the emitted photon
wavelength_nm
``````
```output
```
It appears that there is still no output from the code. Let's ensure that we explicitly print the wavelength of the emitted photon in nanometers. I will modify the code to include a print statement for the wavelength.

### Updated Code with Print Statement
Here’s the revised code that includes a print statement to display the wavelength of the emitted photon:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Constants
m = 9.109e-31  # mass of electron in kg
hbar = 1.055e-34  # reduced Planck's constant in Js
a = 10e-10  # width of the well in meters

# Quantum numbers
n_values = [1, 2, 3]

# Calculate energy levels
E_levels = [(n**2 * sp.pi**2 * hbar**2) / (2 * m * a**2) for n in n_values]

# Convert energy from Joules to eV (1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J)
E_levels_eV = [E / 1.60218e-19 for E in E_levels]

# Constants for photon calculation
h = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in Js
c = 3.00e8  # speed of light in m/s

# Energy difference for the photon emitted
E_photon = E_levels[n_values[2] - 1] - E_levels[n_values[1] - 1]  # E_3 - E_2

# Wavelength of the emitted photon
wavelength = h * c / E_photon  # in meters

# Convert wavelength to nanometers
wavelength_nm = wavelength * 1e9  # convert to nm

# Print the wavelength of the emitted photon
print(f"Wavelength of emitted photon: {wavelength_nm:.4f} nm")
``````
```output
Wavelength of emitted photon: 659.3237 nm
```
