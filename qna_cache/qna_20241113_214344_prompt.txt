EXERCISE PROBLEM

**Ex 2.3** (a) The width of an infinite potential well is 12 Å. Determine the first three allowed energy levels (in eV) for an electron. (b) Repeat part (a) for a proton.

$$\begin{array}{l}
\Lambda^3 + 01 \times 8T^1 \Lambda^3 + 01 \times 0L^5 \Lambda^3 + 01 \times 5T^1 (q) \Lambda^3 1S^3 \Sigma^+ \Lambda^3 \Phi 01 \Lambda^3 \Gamma 9 \Sigma (p) \text{surv}
\end{array}$$

<|begin_image|> Figure 2.7a shows the first four allowed energies for the particle in the infinite potential well, and Figure 2.7b,c shows the corresponding wave functions and probability functions. We may note that as the energy increases, the probability of finding the particle at any given value of x becomes more uniform.

A particular form of solution to this equation is given by

$$y(x) = A_1 \cos kx + A_2 \sin kx \tag{2.29}$$

where

$$k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \tag{2.30}$$

One boundary condition is that the wave function $y(x)$ must be continuous so that

$$y(x = 0) = y(x = a) = 0 \tag{2.31}$$

Applying the boundary condition at $x = 0$, we must have that $A_1 = 0$. At $x = a$, we have

$$y(x = a) = 0 = A_2 \sin ka \tag{2.32}$$

This equation is valid if $ka = n\pi$, where the parameter $n$ is a positive integer, or $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$. The parameter $n$ is referred to as a quantum number. We can write

$$k = \frac{n\pi}{a} \tag{2.33}$$

Negative values of $n$ simply introduce a negative sign in the wave function and yield redundant solutions for the probability density function. We cannot physically distinguish any difference between $+n$ and $-n$ solutions. Because of this redundancy, negative values of $n$ are not considered.

The coefficient $A_2$ can be found from the normalization boundary condition that was given by Equation (2.18) as $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y(x)y^*(x)dx = 1$. If we assume that the wavefunction solution ψ(x) is a real function, then ψ(x) = ψ*(x). Substituting the wave function into Equation (2.18), we have

$$
\int_0^a A_2^2 \sin^2 kx \, dx = 1
$$

(2.34)

Evaluating this integral gives

$$
A_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}
$$

(2.35)

Finally, the time-independent wave solution is given by

$$
ψ(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin \left( \frac{nπx}{a} \right) \quad \text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
$$

(2.36)

This solution represents the electron in the infinite potential well and is a standing wave solution. The free electron was represented by a traveling wave, and now the bound particle is represented by a standing wave.

The parameter k in the wave solution was defined by Equations (2.30) and (2.33). Equating these two expressions for k, we obtain

$$
k^2 = k_n^2 = \frac{2mE_n}{\hbar^2} = \frac{n^2π^2}{a^2}
$$

(2.37)

The total energy can then be written as

$$
E = E_n = \frac{\hbar^2 n^2π^2}{2ma^2} \quad \text{where } n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
$$

(2.38)

For the particle in the infinite potential well, the wave function is now given by
-------------
$$
ψ(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin k_n x
$$

(2.39)

where the constant k_n from Equation (2.37), must have discrete values, implying that the total energy of the particle can only have discrete values. This result means that the energy of the particle is quantized. That is, the energy of the particle can only have particular discrete values. The quantization of the particle energy is contrary to results from classical physics, which would allow the particle to have continuous energy values. The discrete energies lead to quantum states that will be considered in more detail in this and later chapters. The quantization of the energy of a bound particle is an important result.

This quantization of electron energy will be observed again at the end of the chapter for an electron bound to an ion forming an atom.

^A more thorough analysis shows that |A_2|^2 = 2/a, so solutions for the coefficient A_2 include + √2/a, - √2/a, +j √2/a, -j √2/a, or any complex number whose magnitude is √2/a. Since the wave function itself has no physical meaning, the choice of which coefficient to use is immaterial. They all produce the same probability density function.

### Instruction:
Solve the following question:
Building off of our discussion in lecture about the "particle in an infinite potential well," consider a particle in a finite potential well between 00 and aa in 1-dimension. The potential energy is finite (V0)(V0​) outside of the box and 00 within the box. Beginning with the time-independent Schrödinger equation, complete the following parts: (30 points)

a) Set up the set of wave function equations for the three distinct regions in xx (these can include unknown constants).

b) What are the boundary conditions (hint: wave function and its first derivative must be continuous)?

c) Applying the boundary conditions, determine the expression that describes how the wave number is constrained in order to yield solutions to the wave equation (hint: the answer should be an equation in the form tan⁡(ka)=(some function of k,E, etc.)tan(ka)=(some function of k,E, etc.)).

d) Conceptualization: Disregarding the equations and analysis from parts a-c), sketch the wave function at the first three energy levels within this finite potential well and on the same plot, sketch the wave functions for if the well were an infinite potential well. How are the wave functions qualitatively different?""",
            """(a) The wavelength of green light is λ = 550 nm. If an electron has the same wave-length, determine the electron velocity and momentum. (b) Repeat part (a) for the light with a wavelength of λ = 440 nm. (c) For parts (a) and (b), is the photon equal to the momentum of the electron?""",
            """(a) The de Broglie wavelength of an electron is 85 Å. Determine the electron energy (eV), momentum, and velocity. (b) An electron is moving with a velocity of 8 x 10^5 cm/s. Determine the electron energy (eV), momentum, and de Broglie wavelength (in Å).""",
            """An electron is described by a wave function given by ψ(x) = √(2/a) cos(πx/a) for -a/2 < x < a/2. The wave function is zero elsewhere. Calculate the probability of finding the electron between (a) 0 < x < a/4, (b) a/4 < x < a/2, and (c) -a/2 < x < a/2.""",
            """(a) An electron is bound in a one-dimensional infinite potential well with a width of 10 Å. (a) Calculate the first three energy levels that the electron may occupy. (b) If the electron drops from the third to the second energy level, what is the wavelength of a photon that might be emitted?
By doing the following:
First, reflect on the question (without actually solving it or doing any math) and the context shown above and determine the correct approach/strategy to solving it.
Then, solve the question step by step. If you ever need to solve an equation or calculate the value of an expression, utilize function calling by writing sympy code. But before writing code, plan out what variables will be used and what equations/expressions will be solved, and what should be printed out.
When writing your code block, make sure to define all variables used and use print statements as variables won't be displayed automatically, ie, write ``print(solution)`` instead of ``solution``.
After you output code, I will go and run the code and report whatever is printed to console, like this:
```output
5```
Reflect upon the results and see if they make sense, and continue with the next step as needed. If there is an error, analyze the code and the error and think of ways to fix the error. Then output new code. If you fail to fix the error, think of an alternative way to solve the problem.
Note that after I run the code, I will wipe the memory. Therefor, previously defined symbols and variables will be erased and must be redefined in the next code block you write. For instance, if you found that m=5 in the last code block, you must redefine m=5 in the new code block you write.
Finally, after solving the problem, output "Answer:", followed by the answer.
