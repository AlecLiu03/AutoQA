Each type is characterized by the size of an ordered region within the material. An ordered region is a spatial volume in which atoms or molecules have a regular geometric arrangement or periodicity. Amorphous materials have order only within a few atomic or molecular dimensions, while polycrystalline materials have a high degree of order over many atomic or molecular dimensions. These ordered regions, or single-crystal regions, vary in size and orientation with respect to one another. The single-crystal regions are called grains and are separated from one another by grain boundaries. Single-crystal materials, ideally, have a high degree of order, or regular geometric periodicity, throughout the entire volume of the material. The advantage of a single-crystal material is that, in general, its electrical properties are superior to those of a nonsingle-crystal material, since grain boundaries tend to degrade the electrical characteristics. Two-dimensional representations of amorphous, polycrystalline, and single-crystal materials are shown in Figure 1.1.\n\n<|begin_image|>\n###"}, {"id": 5, "content": "1.3 | SPACE LATTICES\n\nOur primary emphasis in this text will be on the single-crystal material with its regular geometric periodicity in the atomic arrangement.

The periodic arrangement of atoms in the crystal is called the lattice.\n\n####"}, {"id": 6, "content": "1.3.1 | Primitive and Unit Cell\n\nWe can represent a particular atomic array by a dot that is called a lattice point. Figure 1.2 shows an infinite two-dimensional array of lattice points. The simplest means of repeating an atomic array is by translation. Each lattice point in Figure 1.2 can be translated a distance a1 in one direction and a distance b1 in a second noncollinear direction to generate the two-dimensional lattice. A third noncollinear translation will produce the three-dimensional lattice. The translation directions need not be perpendicular.\n\nSince the three-dimensional lattice is a periodic repetition of a group of atoms, we do not need to consider the entire lattice, but only a fundamental unit that is being repeated. A unit cell is a small volume of the crystal that can be used to reproduce the entire crystal. A unit cell is not a unique entity. Figure 1.3 shows several possible unit cells in a two-dimensional lattice.\n\nThe unit cell A can be translated in directions a2 and b2; the unit cell B can be translated in directions a3 and b3, and the entire two-dimensional lattice can be constructed by the translations of either of these unit cells. The unit cells C and D in Figure 1.3 can also be used to construct the entire lattice by using the appropriate translations. This discussion of two-dimensional unit cells can easily be extended to three dimensions to describe a real single-crystal material.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 1.2](image1.png)<|end_image|>\n**Figure 1.2** Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 1.3](image2.png)<|end_image|>\n**Figure 1.3** Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice showing various possible unit cells.\n\nA *primitive cell* is the smallest unit cell that can be repeated to form the lattice.

For example, we can determine the volume density of atoms.\n\n**Objective:** Find the volume density of atoms in a crystal.\n\nConsider a single-crystal material that is a body-centered cubic, as shown in Figure 1.5b, with a lattice constant a = 5 \u00c5 = 5 \u00d7 10^-8 cm. A corner atom is shared by eight unit cells that meet at each corner so that each corner atom effectively contributes one-eighth of its volume to each unit cell.

Any parallel plane is entirely equivalent to any other."}, {"id": 10, "content": "**Ex 1.2** Describe the lattice plane shown in Figure 1.7. [sujgd ([12] 'stuv)]![Figure 1.7](<|begin_image|>) **Figure 1.7 | Figure for Exercise Problem Ex 1.2.**\n\nThree planes that are commonly considered in a cubic crystal are shown in Figure 1.8. The plane in Figure 1.8a is parallel to the b and c axes so the intercepts are given as p = 1, q = \u221e, and s = \u221e. Taking the reciprocal, we obtain the Miller indices as (1, 0, 0), so the plane shown in Figure 1.8a is referred to as the (100) plane. Again, any plane parallel to the one shown in Figure 1.8a and separated by an integral number of lattice constants is equivalent and is referred to as the (100) plane. One advantage to taking the reciprocal of the intercepts to obtain the Miller indices is that the use of infinity is avoided when describing a plane that is parallel to an axis. If we were to describe a plane passing through the origin of our system, we would obtain infinity as one or more of the Miller indices after taking the reciprocal of the intercepts. However, the location of the origin of our system is entirely arbitrary and so, by translating the origin to another equivalent lattice point, we can avoid the use of infinity in the set of Miller indices.\n\nFor the simple cubic structure, the body-centered cubic, and the face-centered cubic, there is a high degree of symmetry. The axes can be rotated by 90\u00b0 in each of the three dimensions and each lattice point can again be described by Equation (1.1) as\n\n$$\\vec{r} = p\\vec{a} + q\\vec{b} + s\\vec{c}$$\n\n(1.1)\n\nEach face plane of the cubic structure shown in Figure 1.8a is entirely equivalent.

The intercepts of the plane shown in Figure 1.8b are p = 1, q = 1, and s = \u221e. The Miller indices are found by taking the reciprocal of these intercepts and, as a result, this plane is referred to as the (110) plane. In a similar way, the plane shown in Figure 1.8c is referred to as the (111) plane.\n\nOne characteristic of a crystal that can be determined is the distance between nearest equivalent parallel planes. Another characteristic is the surface concentration of atoms, number per square centimeter (#/cm\u00b2), that are cut by a particular plane.

Silicon is referred to as a group IV element and has a diamond crystal structure. Germanium is also a group IV element and has the same diamond structure. A unit cell of the diamond structure, shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 1.11<|end_image|>, is more complicated than the simple cubic structures that we have considered up to this point.\n\nWe may begin to understand the diamond lattice by considering the tetrahedral structure shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 1.12<|end_image|>. This structure is basically a body-centered cubic with four of the corner atoms missing. Every atom in the tetrahedral structure has four nearest neighbors and it is this structure that is the basic building block of the diamond lattice.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 1.11<|end_image|> The diamond structure.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 1.12<|end_image|> The tetrahedral structure of closest neighbors in the diamond lattice.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 1.13<|end_image|> Portions of the diamond lattice: (a) bottom half and (b) top half.\n\nThere are several ways to visualize the diamond structure. One way to gain a further understanding of the diamond lattice is by considering <|begin_image|>Figure 1.13<|end_image|>. <|begin_image|>Figure 1.13a<|end_image|> shows two body-centered cubic, or tetrahedral, structures diagonally adjacent to each other. The open circles represent atoms in the lattice that are generated when the structure is translated to the right or left, one lattice constant, a. <|begin_image|>Figure 1.13b<|end_image|> represents the top half of the diamond structure. The top half again consists of two tetrahedral structures joined diagonally, but which are at 90\u00b0 with respect to the bottom-half diagonal. An important characteristic of the diamond lattice is that any atom within the diamond structure will have four nearest neighboring atoms. We will note this characteristic again in our discussion of atomic bonding in the next section. The diamond structure refers to the particular lattice in which all atoms are of the same species, such as silicon or germanium. The zincblende (sphalerite) structure differs from the diamond structure only in that there are two different types of atoms in the lattice. Compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, have the zincblende structure shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 1.14<|end_image|>. The important feature of both the diamond and the zincblende structures is that the atoms are joined together to form a tetrahedron. <|begin_image|>Figure 1.15<|end_image|> shows the basic tetrahedral structure of GaAs in which each Ga atom has four nearest As neighbors and each As atom has four nearest Ga neighbors.

The question arises as to why one particular crystal structure is favored over another for a particular assembly of atoms. A fundamental law of nature is that the total energy of a system in thermal equilibrium tends to reach a minimum value. The interaction that occurs between atoms to form a solid and to reach the minimum total energy depends on the type of atom or atoms involved. The type of bond, or interaction, between atoms, then, depends on the particular atom or atoms in the crystal. If there is not a strong bond between atoms, they will not \u201cstick together\u201d to create a solid.\n\nThe interaction between atoms can be described by quantum mechanics. Although an introduction to quantum mechanics is presented in the next chapter, the quantum-mechanical description of the atomic bonding interaction is still beyond the scope of this text. We can nevertheless obtain a qualitative understanding of how various atoms interact by considering the valence, or outermost, electrons of an atom.\n\nThe atoms at the two extremes of the periodic table (excepting the inert elements) tend to lose or gain valence electrons, thus forming ions. These ions then essentially have complete outer energy shells. The elements in group I of the periodic table tend to lose their one electron and become positively charged, while the elements in group VII tend to gain an electron and become negatively charged. These oppositely charged ions then experience a coulomb attraction and form a bond referred to as an **ionic bond**. If the ions were to get too close, a repulsive force would become dominant, so an equilibrium distance results between these two ions. In a crystal, negatively charged ions tend to be surrounded by positively charged ions and positively charged ions tend to be surrounded by negatively charged ions, so a periodic array of the atoms is formed to create the lattice. A classic example of ionic bonding is sodium chloride.\n\n<|begin_image|>H<|end_image|> - <|begin_image|>H<|end_image|>\n\n(a)\n\n<|begin_image|>H<|end_image|> = <|begin_image|>H<|end_image|>\n\n(b)\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 1.16<|end_image|> | Representation of (a) hydrogen valence electrons and (b) covalent bonding in a hydrogen molecule.\n\n<|begin_image|>Si<|end_image|>\n\n(a)\n\n<|begin_image|>Si<|end_image|> - <|begin_image|>Si<|end_image|>\n\n(b)\n\n<|begin_image|>Si<|end_image|> - <|begin_image|>Si<|end_image|>\n\n-------------"}, {"id": 17, "content": "![Si](https://via.placeholder.com/15)\n\n(a)\n\n![Si](https://via.placeholder.com/15) - ![Si](https://via.placeholder.com/15) - ![Si](https://via.placeholder.com/15)\n\n(b)\n\n**Figure 1.17** | Representation of (a) silicon valence electrons and (b) covalent bonding in the silicon crystal.\n\nThe interaction of atoms tends to form closed valence shells such as we see in ionic bonding. Another atomic bond that tends to achieve closed-valence energy shells is **covalent bonding**, an example of which is found in the hydrogen molecule. A hydrogen atom has one electron and needs one more electron to complete the lowest energy shell. A schematic of two noninteracting hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen molecule with the covalent bonding, is shown in Figure 1.16. Covalent bonding results in electrons being shared between atoms, so that in effect the valence energy shell of each atom is full.\n\nAtoms in group IV of the periodic table, such as silicon and germanium, also tend to form covalent bonds. Each of these elements has four valence electrons and needs four more electrons to complete the valence energy shell. If a silicon atom, for example, has four nearest neighbors, with each neighbor atom contributing one valence electron to be shared, then the center atom will in effect have eight electrons in its outer shell. Figure 1.17a schematically shows five noninteracting silicon atoms with the four valence electrons around each atom. A two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in silicon is shown in Figure 1.17b. The center atom has eight shared valence electrons.\n\nA significant difference between the covalent bonding of hydrogen and of silicon is that, when the hydrogen molecule is formed, it has no additional electrons to form additional covalent bonds, while the outer silicon atoms always have valence electrons available for additional covalent bonding. The silicon array may then be formed into an infinite crystal, with each silicon atom having four nearest neighbors and eight shared electrons. The four nearest neighbors in silicon forming the covalent bond correspond to the tetrahedral structure and the diamond lattice, which were shown in Figures 1.12 and 1.11 respectively. Atomic bonding and crystal structure are obviously directly related.\n\nThe third major atomic bonding scheme is referred to as **metallic bonding**. Group I elements have one valence electron. If two sodium atoms (Z = 11), for example, are brought into close proximity, the valence electrons interact in a way similar to that in covalent bonding. When a third sodium atom is brought into close proximity with the first two, the valence electrons can also interact and continue to form a bond. Solid sodium has a body-centered cubic structure, so each atom has eight near-neighbors with each atom sharing many valence electrons. We may think of the positive metallic ions as being surrounded by a sea of negative electrons, the solid being held together by the electrostatic forces. This description gives a qualitative picture of the metallic bond.\n\nA fourth type of atomic bond, called the Van der Waals bond, is the weakest of the chemical bonds. A hydrogen fluoride (HF) molecule, for example, is formed by an ionic bond. The effective center of the positive charge of the molecule is not the same as the effective center of the negative charge. This nonsymmetry in the charge distribution results in a small electric dipole that can interact with the dipoles of other HF molecules. With these weak interactions, solids formed by the Van der Waals bonds have a relatively low melting temperature\u2014in fact, most of these materials are in gaseous form at room temperature."}, {"id": 18, "content": "### 1.6 | IMPERFECTIONS AND IMPURITIES IN SOLIDS\n\nUp to this point, we have been considering an ideal single-crystal structure. In a real crystal, the lattice is not perfect, but contains imperfections or defects; that is, the perfect geometric periodicity is disrupted in some manner. Imperfections tend to alter the electrical properties of a material and, in some cases, electrical parameters can be dominated by these defects or impurities."}, {"id": 19, "content": "#### 1.6.1 Imperfections in Solids\n\nOne type of imperfection that all crystals have in common is atomic thermal vibration. A perfect single crystal contains atoms at particular lattice sites; the atoms separated from each other by a distance we have assumed to be constant. The atoms in a crystal, however, have a certain thermal energy, which is a function of temperature. The thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate in a random manner about an equilibrium lattice point. This random thermal motion causes the distance between atoms to randomly fluctuate, slightly disrupting the perfect geometric arrangement of atoms. This imperfection, called lattice vibrations, affects some electrical parameters, as we will see later in our discussion of semiconductor material characteristics.\n\nAnother type of defect is called a point defect. There are several of this type that we need to consider. Again, in an ideal single-crystal lattice, the atoms are arranged in a perfect periodic arrangement. However, in a real crystal, an atom may be missing from a particular lattice site. This defect is referred to as a vacancy; it is schematically shown in Figure 1.18a. In another situation, an atom may be located between lattice sites. This defect is referred to as an interstitial and is schematically shown in Figure 1.18b. In the case of vacancy and interstitial defects, not only is the perfect geometric arrangement of atoms broken but also the ideal chemical bonding between atoms is disrupted, which tends to change the electrical properties of the material. A vacancy and interstitial may be in close enough proximity to exhibit an interaction between the two point defects. This vacancy\u2013interstitial defect, also known as a Frenkel defect, produces different effects than the simple vacancy or interstitial.\n\nThe point defects involve single atoms or single-atom locations. In forming single-crystal materials, more complex defects may occur. A line defect, for example, occurs when an entire row of atoms is missing from its normal lattice site. This defect is referred to as a line dislocation and is shown in Figure 1.19. As with a point defect, a line dislocation disrupts both the normal geometric periodicity of the lattice and the ideal atomic bonds in the crystal. This dislocation can also alter the electrical properties of the material, usually in a more unpredictable manner than the simple point defects.\n\nOther complex dislocations can also occur in a crystal lattice. However, this introductory discussion is intended only to present a few of the basic types of defect, and to show that a real crystal is not necessarily a perfect lattice structure. The effect of these imperfections on the electrical properties of a semiconductor will be considered in later chapters.\n\n**Figure 1.18** Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice showing (a) a vacancy defect and (b) an interstitial defect.\n\n**Figure 1.19** A two-dimensional representation of a line dislocation.![Figure 1.20](image_url)"}, {"id": 20, "content": "### 1.6.2 Impurities in Solids\n\nForeign atoms, or impurity atoms, may be present in a crystal lattice.

Some impurities, such as oxygen in silicon, tend to be essentially inert; however, other impurities, such as gold or phosphorus in silicon, can drastically alter the electrical properties of the material.\n\nIn Chapter 4 we will see that, by adding controlled amounts of particular impurity atoms, the electrical characteristics of a semiconductor material can be favorably altered. The technique of adding impurity atoms to a semiconductor material in order to change its conductivity is called doping. There are two general methods of doping: impurity diffusion and ion implantation.\n\nThe actual diffusion process depends to some extent on the material but, in general, impurity diffusion occurs when a semiconductor crystal is placed in a high-temperature (~1000\u00b0C) gaseous atmosphere containing the desired impurity atom. At this high temperature, many of the crystal atoms can randomly move in and out of their single-crystal lattice sites. Vacancies may be created by this random motion so that impurity atoms can move through the lattice by hopping from one vacancy to another. Impurity diffusion is the process by which impurity particles move from a region of high concentration near the surface to a region of lower concentration within the crystal. When the temperature decreases, the impurity atoms become permanently frozen into the substitutional lattice sites. Diffusion of various impurities into selected regions of a semiconductor allows us to fabricate complex electronic circuits in a single semiconductor crystal.\n\nIon implantation generally takes place at a lower temperature than diffusion. A beam of impurity ions is accelerated to kinetic energies in the range of 50 keV or greater and then directed to the surface of the semiconductor. The high-energy impurity ions enter the crystal and come to rest at some average depth from the surface. One advantage of ion implantation is that controlled numbers of impurity atoms can be introduced into specific regions of the crystal. A disadvantage of this technique is that the incident impurity atoms collide with the crystal atoms, causing lattice-displacement damage. However, most of the lattice damage can be removed by thermal annealing, in which the temperature of the crystal is raised for a short time. Thermal annealing is a required step after implantation."}, {"id": 21, "content": "# 1.7 | GROWTH OF SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS\n\nThe success in fabricating very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is a result, to a large extent, of the development of and improvement in the formation or growth of pure single-crystal semiconductor materials. Semiconductors are some of the purest materials. Silicon, for example, has concentrations of most impurities of less than 1 part in 10^10 atoms. The high purity requirement means that extreme care is necessary in the growth and the treatment of the material at each step of the fabrication process. The mechanics and kinetics of crystal growth are extremely complex and will be described in only very general terms in this text. However, a general knowledge of the growth techniques and terminology is valuable."}, {"id": 22, "content": "### 1.7.1 Growth from a Melt\n\nA common technique for growing single-crystal materials is called the Czochralski method. In this technique, a small piece of single-crystal material, known as a seed, is brought into contact with the surface of the same material in liquid phase, and then slowly pulled from the melt. As the seed is slowly pulled, solidification occurs along the plane between the solid\u2013liquid interface. Usually the crystal is also rotated slowly as it is being pulled, to provide a slight stirring action to the melt, resulting in a more uniform temperature. Controlled amounts of specific impurity atoms, such as boron or phosphorus, may be added to the melt so that the grown semiconductor crystal is intentionally doped with the impurity atom. Figure 1.21a shows a schematic of the Czochralski growth process and a silicon ingot or boule grown by this process.\n\nSome impurities may be present in the ingot that are undesirable. Zone refining is a common technique for purifying material. A high-temperature coil, or r-f induction coil, is slowly passed along the length of the boule. The temperature induced by the coil is high enough so that a thin layer of liquid is formed. At the solid\u2013liquid interface, there is a distribution of impurities between the two phases. The parameter that describes this distribution is called the segregation coefficient: the ratio of the concentration of impurities in the solid to the concentration in the liquid. If the segregation coefficient is 0.1, for example, the concentration of impurities in the liquid is a factor of 10 greater than that in the solid. As the liquid zone moves through the material, the impurities are driven along with the liquid. After several passes of the r-f coil, most impurities are at the end of the bar, which can then be cut off. The moving molten zone, or the zone-refining technique, can result in considerable purification.\n\nAfter the semiconductor is grown, the boule is mechanically trimmed to the proper diameter and a flat is ground over the entire length of the boule to denote\n\n*Indicates sections that will aid in the total summation of understanding of semiconductor devices, but may be skipped the first time through the text without loss of continuity.![Crystal Puller Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/150)\n\n(a)\n### 1.7.1 Czochralski Growth\n\n- Container\n- Chuck\n- Seed\n- Crystal\n- Tube\n- Heaters\n- Melt\n- Crucible\n\n<|begin_image|>![Silicon Wafer](https://via.placeholder.com/150)<|end_image|>\n\n(b)\n\n**Figure 1.21** [(a) Model of a crystal puller and (b) photograph of a silicon wafer with an array of integrated circuits.

This then allows the individual chips to be fabricated along given crystal planes so that the chips can be sawed apart more easily. The boule is then sliced into wafers. The wafer must be thick enough to mechanically support itself. A mechanical two-sided lapping operation produces a flat wafer of uniform thickness. Since the lapping procedure can leave a surface damaged and contaminated by the mechanical operation, the surface must be removed by chemical etching. The final step is polishing. This provides a smooth surface on which devices may be fabricated or further growth processes may be carried out. This final semiconductor wafer is called the substrate material."}, {"id": 23, "content": "### 1.7.2 Epitaxial Growth\n\nA common and versatile growth technique that is used extensively in device and integrated circuit fabrication is epitaxial growth. Epitaxial growth is a process whereby a thin, single-crystal layer of material is grown on the surface of a single-crystal substrate. In the epitaxial process, the single-crystal substrate acts as the seed, although the process takes place far below the melting temperature. When an epitaxial layer is grown on a substrate of the same material, the process is termed homoepitaxy. Growing silicon on a silicon substrate is one example of a homoepitaxy process. At present, a great deal of work is being done with heteroepitaxy. In a heteroepitaxy process, although the substrate and epitaxial materials are not the same, the two crystal structures should be very similar if single-crystal growth is to be obtained and if a large number of defects are to be avoided at the epitaxial-substrate interface. Growing epitaxial layers of the ternary alloy AlGaAs on a GaAs substrate is one example of a heteroepitaxy process.\n\nOne epitaxial growth technique that has been used extensively is called chemical vapor-phase deposition (CVD). Silicon epitaxial layers, for example, are grown on silicon substrates by the controlled deposition of silicon atoms onto the surface from a chemical vapor containing silicon. In one method, silicon tetrachloride reacts with hydrogen at the surface of a heated substrate. The silicon atoms are released in the reaction and can be deposited onto the substrate, while the other chemical reactant, HCl, is in gaseous form and is swept out of the reactor. A sharp demarcation between the impurity doping in the substrate and in the epitaxial layer can be achieved using the CVD process. This technique allows great flexibility in the fabrication of semiconductor devices.\n\nLiquid-phase epitaxy is another epitaxial growth technique. A compound of the semiconductor with another element may have a melting temperature lower than that of the semiconductor itself. The semiconductor substrate is held in the liquid compound and, since the temperature of the melt is lower than the melting temperature of the substrate, the substrate does not melt. As the solution is slowly cooled, a single-crystal semiconductor layer grows on the seed crystal. This technique, which occurs at a lower temperature than the Czochralski method, is useful in growing group III\u2013V compound semiconductors.\n\nA versatile technique for growing epitaxial layers is the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) process. A substrate is held in vacuum at a temperature normally in the range of 400 to 800\u00b0C, a relatively low temperature compared with many semiconductor-processing steps. Semiconductor and dopant atoms are then evaporated onto the surface of the substrate. In this technique, the doping can be precisely controlled resulting in very complex doping profiles. Complex ternary compounds, such as AlGaAs, can be grown on substrates, such as GaAs, where abrupt changes in the crystal composition are desired. Many layers of various types of epitaxial compositions can be grown on a substrate in this manner. These structures are extremely beneficial in optical devices such as laser diodes."}, {"id": 24, "content": "### 1.8 | SUMMARY\n\n- A few of the most common semiconductor materials were listed.

But certain experimental results, involving electrons and light waves, appear to be inconsistent with classical physics. However, these experimental results can be predicted using the principles of quantum mechanics. The behavior and characteristics of electrons in a semiconductor can be described by the formulation of quantum mechanics called wave mechanics. The essential elements of this wave mechanics, using Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave equation, are presented in this chapter.\n\nThe goal of this chapter is to provide a brief introduction to quantum mechanics so that readers gain an understanding of and become comfortable with the analysis techniques.

If monochromatic light is incident on a clean surface of a material, then under certain conditions, electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from the surface. According to classical physics, if the intensity of the light is large enough, the work function of the material will be overcome and an electron will be emitted from the surface independent of the incident frequency. This result is not observed. The observed effect is that at a constant incident intensity, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron varies linearly with frequency with a limiting frequency \\(v = v_0\\), below which no photoelectron is produced. This result is shown in <|begin_image|>. If the incident intensity varies at a constant frequency, the rate of photoelectron emission changes, but the maximum kinetic energy remains the same.\n\nPlanck postulated in 1900 that thermal radiation is emitted from a heated surface in discrete packets of energy called quanta. The energy of these quanta is given by \\(E = h\\nu\\), where \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency of the radiation and \\(h\\) is a constant now known as Planck\u2019s constant (\\(h = 6.625 \\times 10^{-34}\\) J-s). Then in 1905, Einstein interpreted the photoelectric results by suggesting that the energy in a light wave is also contained\n\n<|begin_image|>\n\n**Figure 2.1** (a) The photoelectric effect and (b) the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron as a function of incident frequency.\n\nin discrete packets or bundles. The particle-like packet of energy is called a **photon**, whose energy is also given by \\(E = hv\\). A photon with sufficient energy, then, can knock an electron from the surface of the material. The minimum energy required to remove an electron is called the **work function** of the material and any excess photon energy goes into the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. This result was confirmed experimentally as demonstrated in Figure 2.1. The photoelectric effect shows the discrete nature of the photon and demonstrates the particle-like behavior of the photon.\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron can be written as\n\n\\[T = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = hv - \\Phi = hv - hv_0 \\quad (v \\geq v_0)\\]\n\n\\[\\Phi = hv_0\\]\n\nwhere \\(hv\\) is the incident photon energy and \\(\\Phi = hv_0\\) is the minimum energy, or work function, required to remove an electron from the surface.\n\n---\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the photon energy corresponding to a particular wavelength.\n\nConsider an x-ray with a wavelength of \\(\\lambda = 0.708 \\times 10^{-8}\\) cm.\n---\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe energy is\n\n\\[E = hv = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} = \\frac{(6.625 \\times 10^{-34})(3 \\times 10^{10})}{0.708 \\times 10^{-8}} = 2.81 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nThis value of energy may be given in the more common unit of electron-volt (see Appendix D).

The particle-like behavior of electromagnetic waves was also instrumental in the explanation of the Compton effect. In this experiment, an x-ray beam was incident on a solid. A portion of the x-ray beam was deflected and the frequency of the deflected wave had shifted compared with the incident wave. The observed change in frequency and the deflected angle corresponded exactly to the expected results of a \u201cbillard ball\u201d collision between an x-ray quanta, or photon, and an electron in which both energy and momentum are conserved.\n\nIn 1924, de Broglie postulated the existence of matter waves. He suggested that since waves exhibit particle-like behavior, particles should be expected to show wave-like properties. The hypothesis of de Broglie was the existence of a wave-particle duality principle. The momentum of a photon is given by\n\n$$\np = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}\n$$\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light wave. Then, de Broglie hypothesized that the wavelength of a particle can be expressed as\n\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\n$$\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is the momentum of the particle and \\(\\lambda\\) is known as the de Broglie wavelength of the matter wave.\n\nThe wave nature of electrons has been tested in several ways. In one experiment by Davisson and Germer in 1927, electrons from a heated filament were accelerated at normal incidence onto a single crystal of nickel. A detector measured the scattered electrons as a function of angle. Figure 2.2 shows the experimental setup and Figure 2.3 shows the results. The existence of a peak in the density of scattered electrons can be explained as a constructive interference of waves scattered by the periodic atoms in the planes of the nickel crystal. The angular distribution is very similar to an interference pattern produced by light diffracted from a grating.\n\nIn order to gain some appreciation of the frequencies and wavelengths involved in the wave-particle duality principle, Figure 2.4 shows the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. We see that a wavelength of 72.7 \u00c5 obtained in the next example is in the ultraviolet range.

The uncertainty principle describes a fundamental relationship between conjugate variables, including position and momentum and also energy and time.\n\nThe first statement of the uncertainty principle is that it is impossible to simultaneously describe with absolute accuracy the position and momentum of a particle. If the uncertainty in the momentum is \u0394p and the uncertainty in the position is \u0394x, then the uncertainty principle is stated as\n\n$$\u0394p \u0394x \u2243 \u0127$$\n\nwhere \u0127 is defined as \u0127 = h/2\u03c0 = 1.054 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s and is called a modified Planck\u2019s constant. This statement may be generalized to include angular position and angular momentum.\n\nThe second statement of the uncertainty principle is that it is impossible to simultaneously describe with absolute accuracy the energy of a particle and the instant of time the particle has this energy. Again, if the uncertainty in the energy is given by \u0394E and the uncertainty in the time is given by \u0394t, then the uncertainty principle is stated as\n\n$$\u0394E \u0394t \u2243 \u0127$$\n\nOne way to visualize the uncertainty principle is to consider the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum, and the simultaneous measurement of energy and time. The uncertainty principle implies that these simultaneous measurements are in error to a certain extent. However, the modified Planck\u2019s constant \u0127 is very small; the uncertainty principle is only significant for subatomic particles. We must keep in mind nevertheless that the uncertainty principle is a fundamental statement and does not deal only with measurements.\n\nOne consequence of the uncertainty principle is that we cannot, for example, determine the exact position of an electron. We will, instead, determine the probability of finding an electron at a particular position. In later chapters, we will develop a probability density function that will allow us to determine the probability that an electron has a particular energy.

The first concept needed is that of *electron spin*. The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, which is quantized and may take on one of two possible values. The spin is designated by a quantum number s, which has a value of s = +1/2 or s = -1/2. We now have four basic quantum numbers: n, l, m, and s.\n\nThe second concept needed is the *Pauli exclusion principle*. The Pauli exclusion principle states that, in any given system (an atom, molecule, or crystal), no two electrons may occupy the same quantum state. In an atom, the exclusion principle means that no two electrons may have the same set of quantum numbers. We will see that the exclusion principle is also an important factor in determining the distribution of electrons among available energy states in a crystal.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 2.11](https://example.com/figure2.11.png)<|end_image|>\n**Figure 2.11** The radial probability density function for the one-electron atom in the (a) lowest energy state and (b) next-higher energy state.\n\n(From Eisberg and Resnick [5].)The first is the solution of Schrodinger\u2019s wave equation, which again yields electron probability functions, as it did for the simpler potential functions. In developing the physics of semiconductor materials in later chapters, we will also be considering electron probability functions. The second result is the quantization of allowed energy levels for the bound electron. The third is the concept of quantum numbers and quantum states, which evolved from the separation-of-variables technique. We will consider this concept again in the next section and in later chapters when we deal with the semiconductor material physics.\n\n**Table 2.1 | Initial portion of the periodic table**\n\n| Element | Notation | n | l | m | s |\n|---------|----------|---|---|---|---|\n| Hydrogen | 1s<sup>1</sup> | 1 | 0 | 0 | +1/2 or -1/2 |\n| Helium | 1s<sup>2</sup> | 1 | 0 | 0 | +1/2 and -1/2 |\n| Lithium | 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>1</sup> | 2 | 0 | 0 | +1/2 or -1/2 |\n| Beryllium | 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup> | 2 | 0 | 0 | +1/2 and -1/2 |\n| Boron | 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>1</sup> | 2 | 1 | 1 | m = 0, -1, +1 |\n| Carbon | 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>2</sup> | 2 | 1 | 1 | s = +1/2, -1/2 |\n| Nitrogen | 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>3</sup> | 2 | 1 | 1 | m = 0, -1, +1 |\n| Oxygen | 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup> | 2 | 1 | 1 | s = +1/2, -1/2 |\n| Fluorine | 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>5</sup> | 2 | 1 | 1 |  |\n| Neon | 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup> | 2 | 1 | 1 |  |\n\nThe third element, lithium, has three electrons.

In each case, the electron spin factor may be +1/2 or -1/2. For n = 2, then, there are eight possible quantum states. Neon has 10 electrons.

This effect is shown schematically in Figure 3.2, where the parameter r0 represents the equilibrium interatomic distance in the crystal. At the equilibrium interatomic distance, there is a band of allowed energies, but within the allowed band, the energies are at discrete levels. The Pauli exclusion principle states that the joining of atoms to form a system (crystal) does not alter the total number of quantum states regardless of size. However, since no two electrons can have the same quantum number, the discrete energy must split into a band of energies in order that each electron can occupy a distinct quantum state.\n\nWe have seen previously that, at any energy level, the number of allowed quantum states is relatively small. In order to accommodate all of the electrons in a crystal, we must have many energy levels within the allowed band. As an example, suppose that we have a system with 10^19 one-electron atoms and also suppose that, at the equilibrium interatomic distance, the width of the allowed energy band is 1 eV. For simplicity, we assume that each electron in the system occupies a different energy level and, if the discrete energy states are equidistant, then the energy levels are separated by 10^-19 eV. This energy difference is extremely small, so that for all practical purposes, we have a quasi-continuous energy distribution through the allowed energy band. The fact that 10^-19 eV is a very small difference between two energy states can be seen from the following example.\n\n**EXAMPLE 3.1 Objective:** Calculate the change in kinetic energy of an electron when the velocity changes by a small amount.\n\nConsider an electron traveling at a velocity of 10^7 cm/s. Assume that the velocity increases by a value of 1 cm/s. The increase in kinetic energy is given by\n\n\u0394E = \\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 - \\frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m(v_2^2 - v_1^2)\n\nLet v_2 = v_1 + \u0394v. Then\n\nv_2^2 = (v_1 + \u0394v)^2 = v_1^2 + 2v_1\u0394v + (\u0394v)^2But \u0394v \u226a v, so we have that\n\n$$\\Delta E \\approx \\frac{1}{2} m(2v_1 \\Delta v) = mv_1 \\Delta v$$\n\n---\n\n### Solution\n\nSubstituting the number into this equation, we obtain\n\n$$\\Delta E = (9.11 \\times 10^{-31})(10^8)(0.01) = 9.11 \\times 10^{-28} \\text{ J}$$\n\nwhich may be converted to units of electron volts as\n\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{9.11 \\times 10^{-28}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19}} = 5.7 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ eV}$$\n\n---\n\n### Comment\n\nA change in velocity of 1 cm/s compared with 10^7 cm/s results in a change in energy of 5.7 \u00d7 10^{-9} eV, which is orders of magnitude larger than the change in energy of 10^{-19} eV between energy states in the allowed energy band. This example serves to demonstrate that a difference in adjacent energy states of 10^{-19} eV is indeed very small, so that the discrete energies within an allowed band may be treated as a quasi-continuous distribution.\n\n---\n\n### EXERCISE PROBLEM\n\n#### Ex 3.1\n\nThe initial velocity of an electron is 10^7 cm/s. If the kinetic energy of the electron increases by \u0394E = 10^{-19} eV, determine the increase in velocity.\n\n$$(s/m \\Delta v) = \\Delta E$$\n\n---\n\nConsider again a regular periodic arrangement of atoms, in which each atom now contains more than one electron. Suppose the atom in this imaginary crystal contains electrons up through the n = 3 energy level. If the atoms are initially very far apart, the electrons in adjacent atoms will not interact and will occupy the discrete energy levels. If these atoms are brought closer together, the outermost electrons in the n = 3 energy shell will begin to interact initially, so that this discrete energy level will split into a band of allowed energies. If the atoms continue to move closer together, the electrons in the n = 2 shell may begin to interact and will also split into a band of allowed energies. Finally, if the atoms become sufficiently close together, the innermost electrons in the n = 1 level may interact, so that this energy level may also split into a band of allowed energies. The splitting of these discrete energy levels is qualitatively shown in Figure 3.3. If the equilibrium interatomic distance is r_e, then we have bands of allowed energies that the electrons may occupy separated by bands of forbidden energies. This energy-band splitting and the formation of allowed and forbidden bands is the energy-band theory of single-crystal materials.\n\nThe actual band splitting in a crystal is much more complicated than indicated in Figure 3.3. A schematic representation of an isolated silicon atom is shown in Figure 3.4a. Ten of the 14 silicon atom electrons occupy deep-lying energy levels close to the nucleus. The four remaining valence electrons are relatively weakly bound and are the electrons involved in chemical reactions. Figure 3.4b shows the band splitting of silicon. We need only consider the n = 3 level for the valence electrons, since the first two energy shells are completely full and are tightly bound to the nucleus. The 3s state corresponds to n = 3 and l = 0 and contains two quantum states per atom. This state will contain two electrons at T = 0 K. The 3p state corresponds to n = 3 and l = 1 and contains six quantum states per atom. This state will contain the remaining two electrons in the individual silicon atom.\n\nAs the interatomic distance decreases, the 3s and 3p states interact and overlap. At the equilibrium interatomic distance, the bands have again split, but now four quantum states per atom are in the lower band and four quantum states per atom are in the upper band. At absolute zero degrees, electrons are in the lowest energy state, so that all states in the lower band (the valence band) will be full and all states in the upper band (the conduction band) will be empty. The bandgap energy E_g between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band is the width of the forbidden energy band.\n\nWe have discussed qualitatively how and why bands of allowed and forbidden energies are formed in a crystal. The formation of these energy bands is directly related to the electrical characteristics of the crystal, as we will see later in our discussion."}, {"id": 60, "content": "### 3.1.2 The Kronig\u2013Penney Model\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed qualitatively the splitting of allowed electron energies as atoms are brought together to form a crystal. The concept of allowed and forbidden energy bands can be developed more rigorously by considering quantum mechanics and Schrodinger\u2019s wave equation. It may be easy for the reader to \u201cget lost\u201d in the following derivation, but the result forms the basis for the energy-band theory of semiconductors.\n\nThe potential function of a single, noninteracting, one-electron atom is shown in Figure 3.5a. Also indicated on the figure are the discrete energy levels allowed for the electron. Figure 3.5b shows the same type of potential function for the case when several atoms in close proximity are arranged in a one-dimensional array. The potential functions of adjacent atoms overlap, and the net potential function for this case is shown in Figure 3.5c. It is this potential function we would need to use in Schrodinger\u2019s wave equation to model a one-dimensional single-crystal material.\nThe solution to Schrodinger\u2019s wave equation, for this one-dimensional single-crystal lattice, is made more tractable by considering a simpler potential function. Figure 3.6 is the one-dimensional Kronig\u2013Penney model of the periodic potential function, which is used to represent a one-dimensional single-crystal lattice. We need to solve Schrodinger\u2019s wave equation in each region. As with previous quantum mechanical problems, the more interesting solution occurs for the case when E < V_0, which corresponds to a particle being bound within the crystal. The electrons are contained in the potential wells, but we have the possibility of tunneling between wells. The Kronig\u2013Penney model is an idealized periodic potential representing a one-dimensional single crystal, but the results will illustrate many of the important features of the quantum behavior of electrons in a periodic lattice.\n\nTo obtain the solution to Schrodinger\u2019s wave equation, we make use of a mathematical theorem by Bloch. The theorem states that all one-electron wave functions, for problems involving periodically varying potential energy functions, must be of the form\n\n$$\n\\psi(x) = u(x)e^{ikx}\n$$\n\n*Indicates sections that will aid in the total summation of understanding of semiconductor devices, but may be skipped the first time through the text without loss of continuity.\n\n[^1]: Other techniques, such as the nearly free electron model, can be used to predict the energy-band theory of semiconductor materials.

Figure 3.12 shows a two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in a single-crystal silicon lattice. This figure represents silicon at T = 0 K in which each silicon atom is surrounded by eight valence electrons that are in their lowest energy state and are directly involved in the covalent bonding. Figure 3.4b represented the splitting of the discrete silicon energy states into bands of allowed energies as the silicon crystal is formed. At T = 0 K, the 4N states in the lower band, the valence band, are filled with the valence electrons. All of the valence electrons schematically shown in Figure 3.12 are in the valence band. The upper energy band, the conduction band, is completely empty at T = 0 K.\n\nAs the temperature increases above 0 K, a few valence band electrons may gain enough thermal energy to break the covalent bond and jump into the conduction band. Figure 3.13a shows a two-dimensional representation of this bond-breaking\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 3.12](https://example.com/figure3.12.png)\n**Figure 3.12** Two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in a semiconductor at T = 0 K.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 3.13](https://example.com/figure3.13.png)\n**Figure 3.13** (a) Two-dimensional representation of the breaking of a covalent bond.

This means that, as the negatively charged electron breaks away from its covalent bonding position, a positively charged \u201cempty state\u201d is created in the original covalent bonding position in the valence band. As the temperature further increases, more covalent bonds are broken, more electrons jump to the conduction band, and more positive \u201cempty states\u201d are created in the valence band.\n\nWe can also relate this bond breaking to the E versus k energy bands. Figure 3.14a shows the E versus k diagram of the conduction and valence bands at T = 0 K. The energy states in the valence band are completely full and the states in the conduction band are empty. Figure 3.14b shows these same bands for T > 0 K, in which some electrons have gained enough energy to jump to the conduction band and have left empty states in the valence band. We are assuming at this point that no external forces are applied so the electron and \u201cempty state\u201d distributions are symmetrical with k.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Graph](image_url)\n**Figure 3.14** | The E versus k diagram of the conduction and valence bands of a semiconductor at (a) T = 0 K and (b) T > 0 K."}, {"id": 71, "content": "**3.2.2 Drift Current**\n\nCurrent is due to the net flow of charge.

The summation in Equation (3.33) is taken over a unit volume so that the current density J is still in units of A/cm^2.\n\nSince electrons are charged particles, a net drift of electrons in the conduction band will give rise to a current. The electron distribution in the conduction band, as shown in Figure 3.14b, is an even function of k when no external force is applied. Recall that k for a free electron is related to momentum so that, since there are as many electrons with a +|k| value as there are with a -|k| value, the net drift current density due to these electrons is zero. This result is certainly expected since there is no externally applied force.\n\nIf a force is applied to a particle and the particle moves, it must gain energy. This effect is expressed as\n\n$$dE = F dx = F v dt$$\n\n(3.34)\n\nwhere F is the applied force, dx is the differential distance the particle moves, v is the velocity, and dE is the increase in energy. If an external force is applied to the electrons in the conduction band, there are empty energy states into which the electrons can move; therefore, because of the external force, electrons can gain energy and a net momentum. The electron distribution in the conduction band may look like that shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 3.15<|end_image|>, which implies that the electrons have gained a net momentum.\n\nWe may write the drift current density due to the motion of electrons as\n\n$$J = -e \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i$$\n\n(3.35)\n\nwhere e is the magnitude of the electronic charge and n is the number of electrons per unit volume in the conduction band.

In addition to an externally applied force, there are internal forces in the crystal due to positively charged ions or protons and negatively charged electrons, which will influence the motion of electrons in the lattice. We can write\n\n$$F_{total} = F_{ext} + F_{int} = ma$$\n\n(3.36)\n\nwhere F_total, F_ext, and F_int are the total force, the externally applied force, and the internal forces, respectively, acting on a particle in a crystal. The parameter a is the acceleration and m is the rest mass of the particle.\n\nSince it is difficult to take into account all of the internal forces, we will write the equation\n\n$$F_{ext} = m^* a$$\n\n(3.37)\n\nwhere the acceleration a is now directly related to the external force. The parameter m^*, called the effective mass, takes into account the particle mass and also takes into account the effect of the internal forces.\n\nTo use an analogy for the effective mass concept, consider the difference in motion between a glass marble in a container filled with water and in a container filled with oil. In general, the marble will drop through the water at a faster rate than through the oil. The external force in this example is the gravitational force and the internal forces are related to the viscosity of the liquids. Because of the difference in motion of the marble in these two cases, the mass of the marble would appear to be different in water than in oil. (As with any analogy, we must be careful not to be too literal.)\n\nWe can also relate the effective mass of an electron in a crystal to the E versus k curves, such as is shown in Figure 3.11. In a semiconductor material, we will be dealing with allowed energy bands that are almost empty of electrons and other energy bands that are almost full of electrons.\n\nTo begin, consider the case of a free electron whose E versus k curve is shown in Figure 3.7. Recalling Equation (3.28), the energy and momentum are related by E = p^2/2m = \u0127^2k^2/2m, where m is the mass of the electron. The momentum and wave number k are related by p = \u0127k.

The first derivative of **E** with respect to **k** is related to the velocity of the particle.\n\nIf we now take the second derivative of **E** with respect to **k**, we have\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m}\n$$\n\n(3.40)\n\nWe may rewrite Equation (3.40) as\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{1}{m}\n$$\n\n(3.41)\n\nThe second derivative of **E** with respect to **k** is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle. For the case of a free electron, the mass is a constant (nonrelativistic effect), so the second derivative function is a constant. We may also note from Figure 3.7 that **d^2E/dk^2** is a positive quantity, which implies that the mass of the electron is also a positive quantity.\n\nIf we apply an electric field to the free electron and use Newton's classical equation of motion, we can write\n\n$$\nF = ma = -eE\n$$\n\n(3.42)\n\nwhere **a** is the acceleration, **E** is the applied electric field, and **e** is the magnitude of the electronic charge.

For T > 0 K, all valence electrons may gain thermal energy; if a valence electron gains a small amount of thermal energy, it may hop into the empty state. The movement of a valence electron into the empty state is equivalent to the movement of the positively charged empty state itself. Figure 3.17 shows the movement of valence electrons in the crystal, alternately filling one empty state and creating a new empty state\u2014a motion equivalent to a positive charge moving in the valence band. The crystal now has a second equally important charge carrier that can give rise to a current. This charge carrier is called a hole and, as we will see, can also be thought of as a classical particle whose motion can be modeled using Newtonian mechanics.\n\nThe drift current density due to electrons in the valence band, such as shown in Figure 3.14b, can be written as\n\n$$J = -e \\sum_{i(\\text{filled})} v_i$$\n\n(3.49)\n\nwhere the summation extends over all filled states. This summation is inconvenient since it extends over a nearly full valence band and takes into account a very large number of states. We may rewrite Equation (3.49) in the form\n\n$$J = -e \\sum_{i(\\text{filled})} v_i + e \\sum_{i(\\text{empty})} v_i$$\n\n(3.50)\n\nIf we consider a band that is totally full, all available states are occupied by electrons.

The net drift current density generated from a completely full band, then, is zero, or\n\n$$-e \\sum_{i(\\text{full})} v_i = 0 \\tag{3.51}$$\n\nWe can now write the drift current density from Equation (3.50) for an almost full band as\n\n$$J = +e \\sum_{i(\\text{empty})} v_i \\tag{3.52}$$\n\nwhere the $v_i$ in the summation is the\n\n$$v(E) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE}{dk}\\right)$$\n\nassociated with the empty state. Equation (3.52) is entirely equivalent to placing a positively charged particle in the empty states and assuming all other states in the band are empty, or neutrally charged. This concept is shown in Figure 3.18. Figure 3.18a shows the valence band with the conventional electron-filled states and empty states, whereas Figure 3.18b shows the new concept of positive charges occupying the original empty states. This concept is consistent with the discussion of the positively charged \u201cempty state\u201d in the valence band, as shown in Figure 3.17.\n\nThe $v_i$ in the summation of Equation (3.52) is related to how well this positively charged particle moves in the semiconductor.

The energy near the top of the allowed energy band may again be approximated by a parabola so that we may write\n\n$$(E - E_c) = -C_2(k)^2 \\tag{3.53}$$\n\nThe energy $E_c$ is the energy at the top of the energy band. Since $E < E_c$ for electrons in this band, the parameter $C_2$ must be a positive quantity.\n\nTaking the second derivative of $E$ with respect to $k$ from Equation (3.53), we obtain\n\n$$\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = -2C_2 \\tag{3.54}$$\n\nWe may rearrange this equation so that\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{-2C_2}{\\hbar^2} \\tag{3.55}$$\n\nComparing Equation (3.55) with Equation (3.41), we may write\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{h^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{-2C_2}{h^2} = \\frac{1}{m^*} \\tag{3.56}\n$$\n\nwhere $m^*$ is again an effective mass.

The attempt to relate these two theories leads to this strange result of a negative effective mass. However, we must recall that solutions to Schrodinger's wave equation also led to results that contradicted classical mechanics. The negative effective mass is another such example.\n\nIn discussing the concept of effective mass in the previous section, we used an analogy of marbles moving through two liquids. Now consider placing an ice cube in the center of a container filled with water: the ice cube will move upward toward the surface in a direction opposite to the gravitational force. The ice cube appears to have a negative effective mass since its acceleration is opposite to the external force. The effective mass parameter takes into account all internal forces acting on the particle.\n\nIf we again consider an electron near the top of an allowed energy band and use Newton's force equation for an applied electric field, we will have\n\n$$\nF = m^* a = -eE \\tag{3.57}\n$$\n\nHowever, <|m^*|> is now a negative quantity, so we may write\n\n$$\na = \\frac{-eE}{-|m^*|} = \\frac{+eE}{|m^*|} \\tag{3.58}\n$$\n\nAn electron moving near the top of an allowed energy band moves in the same direction as the applied electric field.\n\nThe net motion of electrons in a nearly full band can be described by considering just the empty states, provided that a positive electronic charge is associated with each state and that the negative of <|m^*|> from Equation (3.56) is associated with each state. We now can model this band as having particles with a positive electronic charge and a positive effective mass. The density of these particles in the valence band is the same as the density of empty electronic energy states. This new particle is the **hole**.

We noted that the splitting of the energy states in silicon, for example, to form the valence and conduction bands, was complex. Complex band splitting occurs in other crystals, leading to large variations in band structures between various solids and to a wide range of electrical characteristics observed in these various materials. We can qualitatively begin to understand some basic differences in electrical characteristics caused by variations in band structure by considering some simplified energy bands.\n\n<|begin_image|>\n![Image](image_url)\n<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 3.19 |** Allowed energy bands showing (a) an empty band, (b) a completely full band, and (c) the bandgap energy between the two allowed bands.\n\n<|begin_image|>\n![Image](image_url)\n<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 3.20 |** Allowed energy bands showing (a) an almost empty band, (b) an almost full band, and (c) the bandgap energy between the two allowed bands.\n\nThere are several possible energy-band conditions to consider. Figure 3.19a shows an allowed energy band that is completely empty of electrons. If an electric field is applied, there are no particles to move, so there will be no current. Figure 3.19b shows another allowed energy band whose energy states are completely full of electrons. We argued in the previous section that a completely full energy band will also not give rise to a current. A material that has energy bands either completely empty or completely full is an insulator. The resistivity of an insulator is very large or, conversely, the conductivity of an insulator is very small. There are essentially no charged particles that can contribute to a drift current. Figure 3.19c shows a simplified energy-band diagram of an insulator. The bandgap energy <|E_g|> of an insulator is usually on the order of 3.5 to 6 eV or larger, so that at room temperature, there are essentially no electrons in the conduction band and the valence band remains completely full. There are very few thermally generated electrons and holes in an insulator.\n\nFigure 3.20a shows an energy band with relatively few electrons near the bottom of the band. Now, if an electric field is applied, the electrons can gain energy, move to higher energy states, and move through the crystal. The net flow of charge is a current. Figure 3.20b shows an allowed energy band that is almost full of electrons, which means that we can consider the holes in this band. If an electric field is applied, the holes can move and give rise to a current. Figure 3.20c shows the simplified energy-band diagram for this case.

The energy-band diagram for a metal may be in one of two forms.

Similarly, holes in the valence band tend to congregate at the uppermost valence band energy. In GaAs, the minimum conduction band energy and maximum valence band energy occur at the same k value.

This direct nature has significant effect on the optical properties of the material. GaAs and other direct bandgap materials are ideally suited for use in semiconductor lasers and other optical devices.\n\nThe E versus k diagram for silicon is shown in Figure 3.25b. The maximum in the valence band energy occurs at k = 0 as before. The minimum in the conduction band energy occurs not at k = 0, but along the [100] direction.

For example, gas within a container will exert an average pressure on the walls of the vessel. The pressure is actually due to the collisions of the individual gas molecules with the walls, but we do not follow each individual molecule as it collides with the wall. Likewise in a crystal, the electrical characteristics will be determined by the statistical behavior of a large number of electrons.\n\nIn determining the statistical behavior of particles, we must consider the laws that the particles obey. There are three distribution laws determining the distribution of particles among available energy states.\n\nOne distribution law is the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann probability function.

In particular, we use the density of quantum states in the conduction band and the density of quantum states in the valence band along with the Fermi\u2013Dirac probability function to determine the concentration of electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. We also apply the concept of the Fermi energy to the semiconductor material.\n\nThis chapter deals with the semiconductor in equilibrium.

In a semiconductor, two types of charge carrier, the electron and the hole, can contribute to a current. Since the current in a semiconductor is determined largely by the number of electrons in the conduction band and the number of holes in the valence band, an important characteristic of the semiconductor is the density of these charge carriers. The density of electrons and holes is related to the density of states function and the Fermi distribution function, both of which we have considered. A qualitative discussion of these relationships will be followed by a more rigorous mathematical derivation of the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes."}, {"id": 105, "content": "#### 4.1.1 Equilibrium Distribution of Electrons and Holes\n\nThe distribution (with respect to energy) of electrons in the conduction band is given by the density of allowed quantum states times the probability that a state is occupied by an electron. This statement is written in equation form as\n\n$$n(E) = g_c(E)f_F(E)$$\n\nwhere $f_F(E)$ is the Fermi\u2013Dirac probability function and $g_c(E)$ is the density of quantum states in the conduction band. The total electron concentration per unit volume in the conduction band is then found by integrating Equation (4.1) over the entire conduction-band energy.\n\nSimilarly, the distribution (with respect to energy) of holes in the valence band is the density of allowed quantum states in the valence band multiplied by the probability that a state is **not** occupied by an electron. We may express this as\n\n$$p(E) = g_v(E)[1 - f_F(E)]$$\n\nThe total hole concentration per unit volume is found by integrating this function over the entire valence-band energy.\n\nTo find the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations, we need to determine the position of the Fermi energy $E_F$ with respect to the bottom of the conduction-band energy $E_c$ and the top of the valence-band energy $E_v$. To address this question, we will initially consider an intrinsic semiconductor. An ideal intrinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor with no impurity atoms and no lattice defects in the crystal (e.g., pure silicon). We have argued in the previous chapter that, for an intrinsic semiconductor at $T = 0$ K, all energy states in the valence band are filled with electrons and all energy states in the conduction band are empty of electrons. The Fermi energy must, therefore, be somewhere between $E_c$ and $E_v$. (The Fermi energy does not need to correspond to an allowed energy.)\n\nAs the temperature begins to increase above 0 K, the valence electrons will gain thermal energy. A few electrons in the valence band may gain sufficient energy to jump to the conduction band. As an electron jumps from the valence band to the conduction band, an empty state, or hole, is created in the valence band. In an intrinsic![Graph](image_url)\n\nFigure 4.1 [ (a) Density of states functions, Fermi\u2013Dirac probability function, and areas representing electron and hole concentrations for the case when \\(E_F\\) is near the midgap energy; (b) expanded view near the conduction-band energy; and (c) expanded view near the valence-band energy.]\n\nsemiconductor, then, electrons and holes are created in pairs by the thermal energy so that the number of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of holes in the valence band.\n\nFigure 4.1a shows a plot of the density of states function in the conduction-band \\(g_c(E)\\), the density of states function in the valence-band \\(g_v(E)\\), and the Fermi\u2013Dirac probability function for \\(T > 0\\) K when \\(E_F\\) is approximately halfway between \\(E_c\\) and \\(E_v\\). If we assume, for the moment, that the electron and hole effective masses are equal, then \\(g_c(E)\\) and \\(g_v(E)\\) are symmetrical functions about the midgap energy (the energy midway between \\(E_c\\) and \\(E_v\\)). We noted previously that the function \\(f_F(E)\\) for \\(E > E_F\\) is symmetrical to the function \\(1 - f_F(E)\\) for \\(E < E_F\\) about the energy \\(E = E_F\\). This also means that the function \\(f_F(E)\\) for \\(E = E_F + dE\\) is equal to the function \\(1 - f_F(E)\\) for \\(E = E_F - dE\\).Figure 4.1b is an expanded view of the plot in Figure 4.1a showing \\(f_F(E)\\) and \\(g_c(E)\\) above the conduction-band energy \\(E_c\\). The product of \\(g_c(E)\\) and \\(f_F(E)\\) is the distribution of electrons \\(n(E)\\) in the conduction band given by Equation (4.1). This product is plotted in Figure 4.1a. Figure 4.1c, which is an expanded view of the plot in Figure 4.1a shows \\([1 - f_F(E)]\\) and \\(g_v(E)\\) below the valence-band energy \\(E_v\\). The product of \\(g_v(E)\\) and \\([1 - f_F(E)]\\) is the distribution of holes \\(p(E)\\) in the valence band given by Equation (4.2). This product is also plotted in Figure 4.1a. The areas under these curves are then the total density of electrons in the conduction band and the total density of holes in the valence band. From this we see that if \\(g_c(E)\\) and \\(g_v(E)\\) are symmetrical, the Fermi energy must be at the midgap energy in order to obtain equal electron and hole concentrations. If the effective masses of the electron and hole are not exactly equal, then the effective density of states functions \\(g_c(E)\\) and \\(g_v(E)\\) will not be exactly symmetrical about the midgap energy. The Fermi level for the intrinsic semiconductor will then shift slightly from the midgap energy in order to obtain equal electron and hole concentrations."}, {"id": 106, "content": "#### 4.1.2 The \\(n_0\\) and \\(p_0\\) Equations\nWe have argued that the Fermi energy for an intrinsic semiconductor is near midgap.

Now consider adding a group V element, such as phosphorus, as a substitutional impurity. The group V element has five valence electrons. Four of these will contribute to the covalent bonding with the silicon atoms, leaving the fifth more loosely bound to the phosphorus atom. This effect is schematically shown in Figure 4.4. We refer to the fifth valence electron as a donor electron.\n\nThe phosphorus atom without the donor electron is positively charged. At very low temperatures, the donor electron is bound to the phosphorus atom. However, by intuition, it should seem clear that the energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band is considerably less than that for the electrons involved in the covalent bonding. Figure 4.5 shows the energy-band diagram that we would expect. The energy level, E_d, is the energy state of the donor electron.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 4.3] Two-dimensional representation of the intrinsic silicon lattice.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 4.4] Two-dimensional representation of the silicon lattice doped with a phosphorus atom.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 4.5](image_url)\n\n**Figure 4.5** The energy-band diagram showing (a) the discrete donor energy state and (b) the effect of a donor state being ionized.\n\nIf a small amount of energy, such as thermal energy, is added to the donor electron, it can be elevated into the conduction band, leaving behind a positively charged phosphorus ion. The electron in the conduction band can now move through the crystal generating a current, while the positively charged ion is fixed in the crystal. This type of impurity atom donates an electron to the conduction band and so is called a **donor impurity atom**. The donor impurity atoms add electrons to the conduction band without creating holes in the valence band. The resulting material is referred to as an **n-type semiconductor** (n for the negatively charged electron).\n\nNow consider adding a group III element, such as boron, as a substitutional impurity to silicon. The group III element has three valence electrons, which are all taken up in the covalent bonding. As shown in Figure 4.6a, one covalent bonding position appears to be empty. If an electron were to occupy this \u201cempty\u201d position, its energy would have to be greater than that of the valence electrons, since the net charge state of the boron atom would now be negative. However, the electron occupying this \u201cempty\u201d position does not have sufficient energy to be in the conduction band, so its energy is far smaller than the conduction-band energy. Figure 4.6b shows how valence electrons may gain a small amount of thermal energy and move about in\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 4.6](image_url)\n\n**Figure 4.6** Two-dimensional representation of a silicon lattice (a) doped with a boron atom and (b) showing the ionization of the boron atom resulting in a hole.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 4.7](image_url)\n\n**Figure 4.7** The energy-band diagram showing (a) the discrete acceptor energy state and (b) the effect of an acceptor state being ionized.\n\nthe crystal. The \u201cempty\u201d position associated with the boron atom becomes occupied, and other valence electron positions become vacated. These other vacated electron positions can be thought of as holes in the semiconductor material.\n\nFigure 4.7 shows the expected energy state of the \u201cempty\u201d position and also the formation of a hole in the valence band. The hole can move through the crystal generating a current, while the negatively charged boron atom is fixed in the crystal. The group III atom accepts an electron from the valence band and so is referred to as an acceptor impurity atom. The acceptor atom can generate holes in the valence band without generating electrons in the conduction band. This type of semiconductor material is referred to as a p type material (p for the positively charged hole).\n\nThe pure single-crystal semiconductor material is called an intrinsic material. Adding controlled amounts of dopant atoms, either donors or acceptors, creates a material called an extrinsic semiconductor. An extrinsic semiconductor will have either a preponderance of electrons (n type) or a preponderance of holes (p type)."}, {"id": 126, "content": "### 4.2.2 Ionization Energy\n\nWe can calculate the approximate distance of the donor electron from the donor impurity ion, and also the approximate energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band. This energy is referred to as the ionization energy. We will use the Bohr model of the atom for these calculations. The justification for using this model is that the most probable distance of an electron from the nucleus in a hydrogen atom, determined from quantum mechanics, is the same as the Bohr radius. The energy levels in the hydrogen atom determined from quantum mechanics are also the same as obtained from the Bohr theory.\n\nIn the case of the donor impurity atom, we may visualize the donor electron orbiting the donor ion, which is embedded in the semiconductor material. We will need to use the permittivity of the semiconductor material in the calculations rather than the permittivity of free space as is used in the case of the hydrogen atom. We will also use the effective mass of the electron in the calculations. The analysis begins by setting the coulomb force of attraction between the electron and ion equal to the centripetal force of the orbiting electron. This condition will give a steady orbit. We have\n\n$$\n\\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon r^2} = \\frac{m^* v^2}{r_n}\n$$\n\n(4.27)\n\nwhere \\(v\\) is the magnitude of the velocity and \\(r_n\\) is the radius of the orbit.

This radius corresponds to approximately four lattice constants of silicon. Recall that one unit cell in silicon effectively contains eight atoms, so the radius of the orbiting donor electron encompasses many silicon atoms. The donor electron is not tightly bound to the donor atom.\n\nThe total energy of the orbiting electron is given by\n\n$$\nE = T + V\n$$\n\n(4.33)\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the kinetic energy and \\(V\\) is the potential energy of the electron.

If we consider silicon, the ionization energy is E = -25.8 meV, much less than the bandgap energy of silicon. This energy is the approximate ionization energy of the donor atom, or the energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band.\n\nFor ordinary donor impurities such as phosphorus or arsenic in silicon or germanium, this hydrogenic model works quite well and gives some indication of the magnitudes of the ionization energies involved.

The small number of impurity atoms are spread far enough apart so that there is no interaction between donor electrons, for example, in an n-type material. We have assumed that the impurities introduce discrete, noninteracting donor energy states in the n-type semiconductor and discrete, noninteracting acceptor states in the p-type semiconductor. These types of semiconductors are referred to as nondegenerate semiconductors.\n\nIf the impurity concentration increases, the distance between the impurity atoms decreases and a point will be reached when donor electrons, for example, will begin to interact with each other. When this occurs, the single discrete donor energy will split into a band of energies. As the donor concentration further increases, the band of donor states widens and may overlap the bottom of the conduction band. This overlap occurs when the donor concentration becomes comparable with the effective density of states. When the concentration of electrons in the conduction band exceeds the density of states \\(N_c\\), the Fermi energy lies within the conduction band. This type of semiconductor is called a degenerate n-type semiconductor.\n\nIn a similar way, as the acceptor doping concentration increases in a p-type semiconductor, the discrete acceptor energy states will split into a band of energies and may overlap the top of the valence band.

There are \\( g_i \\) ways of choosing where to put the first particle. Each donor level has two possible spin orientations for the donor electron; thus, each donor level has two quantum states.

By adding one electron, the vacancy requirement of the atom is satisfied, and the addition of a second electron in the donor level is not possible.

This means that each acceptor atom has accepted an electron from the valence band so that p_e is zero.

There is a mean time between collisions which may be denoted by \\(\\tau_{cp}\\). If a small electric field (E-field) is applied as indicated in Figure 5.1b, there will be a net drift of the hole in the direction of the E-field, and the net drift velocity will be a small perturbation on the random thermal velocity, so the time between collisions will not be altered appreciably.

The lattice vibrations cause a disruption in the perfect periodic potential function. A perfect periodic potential in a solid allows electrons to move unimpeded, or with no scattering, through the crystal. But the thermal vibrations cause a disruption of the potential function, resulting in an interaction between the electrons or holes and the vibrating lattice atoms. This lattice scattering is also referred to as phonon scattering.\n\nSince lattice scattering is related to the thermal motion of atoms, the rate at which the scattering occurs is a function of temperature. If we denote \u03bc_L as the mobility that would be observed if only lattice scattering existed, then the scattering theory states that to first order\n\n\\[\u03bc_L \u221d T^{-3/2}\\]\n\nMobility that is due to lattice scattering increases as the temperature decreases. Intuitively, we expect the lattice vibrations to decrease as the temperature decreases, which implies that the probability of a scattering event also decreases, thus increasing mobility.\n\n<|begin_image|>\n\nFigure 5.2 shows the temperature dependence of electron and hole mobilities in silicon. In lightly doped semiconductors, lattice scattering dominates and the carrier mobility decreases with temperature as we have discussed. The temperature dependence of mobility is proportional to T^-n. The inserts in the figure show that the parameter n is not equal to 3/2 as the first-order scattering theory predicted. However, mobility does increase as the temperature decreases.\n\nThe second interaction mechanism affecting carrier mobility is called ionized impurity scattering. We have seen that impurity atoms are added to the semiconductor to control or alter its characteristics. These impurities are ionized at room temperature so that a coulomb interaction exists between the electrons or holes and the ionized impurities. This coulomb interaction produces scattering or collisions and also alters the velocity characteristics of the charge carrier.

If temperature increases, the random thermal velocity of a carrier increases, reducing the time the carrier spends in the vicinity of the ionized impurity center. The less time spent in the vicinity of a coulomb force, the smaller the scattering effect and the larger the expected value of \u03bc_I.

The drift velocity of electrons in silicon, for example, saturates at approximately 10\u2077 cm/s at an electric field of approximately 30 kV/cm.

The low-field electron mobility in gallium arsenide is much larger than in silicon. As the field increases, the electron drift velocity in gallium arsenide reaches a peak and then decreases.

In thermal equilibrium, these concentrations are independent of time.

At the same time, electrons moving randomly through the crystal in the conduction band may come in close proximity to holes and \u201cfall\u201d into the empty states in the valence band. This recombination process annihilates both the electron and hole. Since the net carrier concentrations are independent of time in thermal equilibrium, the rate at which electrons and holes are generated and the rate at which they recombine must be equal.

Other symbols will be defined as we advance through the chapter.\n\nElectrons in the valence band may be excited into the conduction band when, for example, high-energy photons are incident on a semiconductor. When this happens, not only is an electron created in the conduction band, but a hole is created in the valence band; thus, an electron-hole pair is generated. The additional electrons and holes created are called excess electrons and excess holes.\n\nThe excess electrons and holes are generated by an external force at a particular rate. Let $g_n^e$ be the generation rate of excess electrons and $g_p^h$ be that of excess holes. These generation rates also have units of #/cm\u00b3\u00b7s.

We may note from Equations (6.5a) and (6.5b) that, in a nonequilibrium condition, \\(np \\neq n_0p_0 = n_i^2\\).\n\nA steady-state generation of excess electrons and holes will not cause a continual buildup of the carrier concentrations. As in the case of thermal equilibrium, an electron in the conduction band may \u201cfall down\u201d into the valence band, leading to the process of excess electron\u2013hole recombination.

The rate at which electrons recombine must be proportional to the electron concentration and must also be proportional to the hole concentration. If there are no electrons or holes, there can be no recombination.\n\nThe net rate of change in the electron concentration can be written as\n\n\\[\\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \\alpha_e \\left[ n_i^2 - n(t)p(t) \\right] \\tag{6.7}\\]"}, {"id": 216, "content": "where\n\n\\[n(t) = n_0 + \\delta n(t) \\tag{6.8a}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[p(t) = p_0 + \\delta p(t) \\tag{6.8b}\\]\n\nThe first term, \\(\\alpha_e n_i^2\\), in Equation (6.7) is the thermal-equilibrium generation rate.

For the p-type semiconductor, then, low injection implies that $\\delta n \\ll p_0$. Assuming that $n_0 \\ll p_0$ and $\\delta n \\ll p_0$, and assuming that $D_e$ and $D_p$ are on the same order of magnitude, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient from Equation (6.44) reduces to\n\n$$D' = D_n$$\n\n(6.45)If we apply the conditions of an extrinsic p-type semiconductor and low injection to the ambipolar mobility, Equation (6.41) reduces to\n\n$$\\mu' = \\mu_n$$\n\n(6.46)"}, {"id": 227, "content": "It is important to note that for an extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection, the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and the ambipolar mobility coefficient reduce to the minority carrier electron parameter values, which are constants.

Note that, for the n-type semiconductor, the ambipolar mobility is a negative value. The ambipolar mobility term is associated with carrier drift; therefore, the sign of the drift term depends on the charge of the particle. The equivalent ambipolar particle is negatively charged, as one can see by comparing Equations (6.30) and (6.39). If the ambipolar mobility reduces to that of a positively charged hole, a negative sign is introduced as shown in Equation (6.48).\n\nThe remaining terms we need to consider in the ambipolar transport equation are the generation rate and the recombination rate. Recall that the electron and hole recombination rates are equal and are given by Equation (6.35) as \\( R_e = R_p = n_i / \\tau_{ui} = p_i / \\tau_{pi} = R_e \\), where \\( \\tau_{ui} \\) and \\( \\tau_{pi} \\) are the mean electron and hole lifetimes, respectively.

Likewise, \\( 1/\\tau_{pi} \\) is the probability per unit time that a hole will encounter an electron and recombine. If we again consider an extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection, the concentration of majority carrier holes will be essentially constant, even when excess carriers are present. Then, the probability per unit time of a minority carrier electron encountering a majority carrier hole will be essentially constant. Hence, the minority carrier electron lifetime, \\( \\tau_{ui} = \\tau_{ui} \\), will remain a constant for the extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection.\n\nSimilarly, if we consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injection, the minority carrier hole lifetime, \\( \\tau_{pi} = \\tau_{pi} \\), will remain constant. Even under the condition of low injection, the minority carrier hole concentration may increase by several orders of magnitude. The probability per unit time of a majority carrier electron encountering a hole may change drastically. The majority carrier lifetime, then, may change substantially when excess carriers are present.\n\nConsider, again, the generation and recombination terms in the ambipolar transport equation.

We may then define a generation rate for excess carriers as \\( g' \\), so that \\( g_n = g_p = g' \\). We also determined that the minority carrier lifetime is essentially a constant for low injection.

Equations (6.55) and (6.56) describe the drift, diffusion, and recombination of excess minority carriers as a function of spatial coordinates and as a function of time. Recall that we had imposed the condition of charge neutrality; the excess minority carrier concentration is equal to the excess majority carrier concentration. The excess majority carriers, then, diffuse and drift with the excess minority carriers; thus, the behavior of the excess majority carrier is determined by the minority carrier parameters.

We considered recombination briefly at the beginning of this chapter and argued that the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the mean carrier lifetime. We have assumed up to this point that the mean carrier lifetime is simply a parameter of the semiconductor material.\n\nWe have been considering an ideal semiconductor in which electronic energy states do not exist within the forbidden-energy bandgap. This ideal effect is present in a perfect single-crystal material with an ideal periodic-potential function. In a real semiconductor material, defects occur within the crystal and disrupt the perfect periodic-potential function. If the density of these defects is not too great, the defects will create discrete electronic energy states within the forbidden-energy band. These allowed energy states may be the dominant effect in determining the mean carrier lifetime.

This equal probability of capture means that the capture cross sections for electrons and holes are approximately equal. The Shockley\u2013Read\u2013Hall theory of recombination assumes that a single recombination center, or trap, exists at an energy $E_t$ within the bandgap. There are four basic processes, shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 6.16<|end_image|>, that may occur at this single trap. We will assume that the trap is an acceptor-type trap; that is, it is negatively charged when it contains an electron and is neutral when it does not contain an electron.\n\nThe four basic processes are as follows:\n\n**Process 1:** The capture of an electron from the conduction band by an initially neutral empty trap.\n\n**Process 2:** The inverse of process 1\u2014the emission of an electron that is initially occupying a trap level back into the conduction band.\n\n**Process 3:** The capture of a hole from the valence band by a trap containing an electron.

However, if a degeneracy factor is included, it will eventually be absorbed in other constants later in the analysis.\n\nFor process 2, the rate at which electrons are emitted from filled traps back into the conduction band is proportional to the number of filled traps, so that\n\n$$R_{en} = E_n N_t f_f(E_t)$$"}, {"id": 244, "content": "(6.88)\n\nwhere\n\n$$R_{en} = \\text{emission rate (\\#/cm^3-s)}$$\n\n$$E_n = \\text{constant}$$\n\n$$f_f(E_t) = \\text{probability that the trap is occupied}$$\n\nIn thermal equilibrium, the rate of electron capture from the conduction band and the rate of electron emission back into the conduction band must be equal.

It is important to realize that the entire semiconductor is a single-crystal material in which one region is doped with acceptor impurity atoms to form the p region and the adjacent region is doped with donor atoms to form the n region. The interface separating the n and p regions is referred to as the **metallurgical junction**.\n\nThe impurity doping concentrations in the p and n regions are shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 7.1b<|end_image|>. For simplicity, we will consider a **step junction** in which the doping concentration is uniform in each region and there is an abrupt change in doping at the junction. Initially, at the metallurgical junction, there is a very large density gradient in both electron and hole concentrations. Majority carrier electrons in the n region will begin diffusing into the p region, and majority carrier holes in the p region will begin diffusing into the n region. If we assume there are no external connections to the semiconductor, then this diffusion process cannot continue indefinitely. As electrons diffuse from the n region, positively charged donor atoms are left behind. Similarly, as holes diffuse from the p region, they uncover negatively charged acceptor atoms. The net positive and negative charges in the n and p regions induce an electric field in the region near the metallurgical junction, in the direction from the positive to the negative charge, or from the n to the p region.\n\nThe net positively and negatively charged regions are shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 7.2<|end_image|>. These two regions are referred to as the **space charge region**. Essentially all electrons and holes are swept out of the space charge region by the electric field. Since the space charge region is depleted of any mobile charge, this region is also referred to as the **depletion region**; these two terms will be used interchangeably. Density gradients still exist in the majority carrier concentrations at each edge of the space charge region. We can think of a density gradient as producing a \u201cdiffusion force\u201d that acts on the majority carriers. These diffusion forces, acting on the electrons and holes at the edges of the space charge region, are shown in the figure. The electric field in the space charge region produces another force on the electrons and holes, which is in the opposite direction to the diffusion force for each type of particle. In thermal equilibrium, the diffusion force and the E-field force exactly balance each other."}, {"id": 264, "content": "7.2 | ZERO APPLIED BIAS\n\nWe have considered the basic pn junction structure and discussed briefly how the space charge region is formed.

The built-in potential barrier maintains equilibrium between majority carrier electrons in the n region and minority carrier electrons in the p region, and also between majority carrier holes in the p region and minority carrier holes in the n region. This potential difference across the junction cannot be measured with a voltmeter because new potential barriers will be formed between the probes and the semiconductor that will cancel V_bi.

This region is essentially depleted of any mobile electrons or holes. A net positive charge density, due to the positively charged donor impurity ions, exists in the n region and a net negative charge density, due to the negatively charged acceptor impurity ions, exists in the p region.\n- An electric field exists in the depletion region due to the net space charge density. The direction of the electric field is from the n region to the p region.\n- A potential difference exists across the space charge region. Under zero applied bias, this potential difference, known as the built-in potential barrier, maintains thermal equilibrium and holds back majority carrier electrons in the n region and majority carrier holes in the p region.\n- An applied reverse-biased voltage (n region positive with respect to the p region) increases the potential barrier, the space charge width, and the magnitude of the electric field.\n- As the reverse-biased voltage changes, the amount of charge in the depletion region changes. This change in charge with voltage defines the junction capacitance.\n- Avalanche breakdown occurs when a sufficiently large reverse-biased voltage is applied to the pn junction. A large reverse-biased current may then be induced in the pn junction. The breakdown voltage, as a function of the doping concentrations in the pn junction, is derived. In a one-sided pn junction, the breakdown voltage is a function of the doping concentration in the low-doped region.\n- The linearly graded junction represents a nonuniformly doped pn junction. Expressions for the electric field, built-in potential barrier, and junction capacitance are derived. The functional relationships differ from those of the uniformly doped junction.\n- Specific doping profiles can be used to obtain specific capacitance characteristics. A hyperbolic junction is one in which the doping decreases away from the metallurgical junction. This type of junction is advantageous in varactor diodes that are used in resonant circuits."}, {"id": 284, "content": "# GLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS\n\n**abrupt junction approximation** The assumption that there is an abrupt discontinuity in space charge density between the space charge region and the neutral semiconductor region.\n\n**avalanche breakdown** The process whereby a large reverse-biased pn junction current is created due to the generation of electron\u2013hole pairs by the collision of electrons and/or holes with atomic electrons within the space charge region.\n\n**built in potential barrier** The electrostatic potential difference between the p and n regions of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium.\n\n**critical electric field** The peak electric field in the space charge region at breakdown.\n\n**depletion layer capacitance** Another term for junction capacitance.\n\n**depletion region** Another term for space charge region.\n\n**hyperabrupt junction** A pn junction in which the doping concentration on one side decreases away from the metallurgical junction to achieve a specific capacitance\u2013voltage characteristic.\n\n**junction capacitance** The capacitance of the pn junction under reverse bias.\n\n**linearly graded junction** A pn junction in which the doping concentrations on either side of the metallurgical junction are approximated by a linear distribution.\n\n**metallurgical junction** The interface between the p- and n-doped regions of a pn junction.\n\n**one-sided junction** A pn junction in which one side of the junction is much more heavily doped than the adjacent side.\n\n**reverse bias** The condition in which a positive voltage is applied to the n region with respect to the p region of a pn junction so that the potential barrier between the two regions increases above the thermal-equilibrium built-in potential barrier.\n\n**space charge region** The region on either side of the metallurgical junction in which there is a net charge density due to ionized donors in the n region and ionized acceptors in the p region.\n\n**space charge width** The width of the space charge region, a function of doping concentrations and applied voltage.\n\n**varactor diode** A diode whose reactance can be varied in a controlled manner with bias voltage."}, {"id": 285, "content": "# CHECKPOINT\n\nAfter studying this chapter, the reader should have the ability to:\n\n- Describe why and how the space charge region is formed.\n- Draw the energy-band diagram of a zero-biased and reverse-biased pn junction.\n- Define and derive the expression of the built-in potential barrier voltage.\n- Derive the expression for the electric field in space charge region of the pn junction.\n- Describe what happens to the parameters of the space charge region when a reverse-biased voltage is applied.\n- Define and explain the junction capacitance.\n- Describe the characteristics and properties of a one-sided pn junction.\n- Describe the avalanche breakdown mechanism in a reverse-biased pn junction.\n- Describe how a linearly graded junction is formed.\n- Define a hyperabrupt junction."}, {"id": 286, "content": "## The pn Junction Diode\n\nIn the last chapter, we discussed the electrostatics of the pn junction in thermal equilibrium and under reverse bias.

Figure 8.1a shows the energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium that was developed in the last chapter. We argued that the potential barrier seen by the electrons, for example, holds back the large concentration of electrons in the n region and keeps them from flowing into the p region. Similarly, the potential barrier seen by the holes holds back the large concentration of holes in the p region and keeps them from flowing into the n region. The potential barrier, then, maintains thermal equilibrium.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 8.1](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 8.1 | A pn junction and its associated energy-band diagram for (a) zero bias, (b) reverse bias, and (c) forward bias.**\n\nFigure 8.1b shows the energy-band diagram of a reverse-biased pn junction. The potential of the n region is positive with respect to the p region so the Fermi energy is in the n region is lower than that in the p region. The total potential barrier is now larger than that for the zero-bias case. We argued in the last chapter that the increased potential barrier continues to hold back the electrons and holes so that there is still essentially no charge flow and hence essentially no current.\n\nFigure 8.1c shows the energy-band diagram for the case when a positive voltage is applied to the p region with respect to the n region. The Fermi level in the p region is now lower than that in the n region. The total potential barrier is now reduced. The smaller potential barrier means that the electric field in the depletion region is also reduced. The smaller electric field means that the electrons and holes are no longer held back in the n and p regions, respectively. There will be a diffusion of holes from the p region across the space charge region where they will flow into the n region. Similarly, there will be a diffusion of electrons from the n region across the space charge region where they will flow into the p region. The flow of charge generates a current through the pn junction.\n\nThe injection of holes into the n region means that these holes are minority carriers. Likewise, the injection of electrons into the p region means that these electrons are minority carriers. The behavior of these minority carriers is described by the ambipolar transport equations that were discussed in Chapter 6. There will be diffusion as well as recombination of excess carriers in these regions. The diffusion of carriers implies that there will be diffusion currents.

The n region contains many more electrons in the conduction band than the p region; the built-in potential barrier prevents this large density of electrons from flowing into the p region. The built-in potential barrier maintains equilibrium between the carrier distributions on either side of the junction.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 8.2 | Conduction-band energy through a pn junction.](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\nAn expression for the built-in potential barrier was derived in the last chapter and was given by Equation (7.10) as\n\n$$V_{bi} = V_c \\ln \\left( \\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2} \\right)$$\n\nIf we divide the equation by \\( V_t = kT/e \\), take the exponential of both sides, and then take the reciprocal, we obtain\n\n\\[ \\frac{n_i^2}{N_a N_d} = \\exp \\left( \\frac{-eV_a}{kT} \\right) \\tag{8.1} \\]\n\nIf we assume complete ionization, we can write\n\n\\[ n_{n0} = N_d \\tag{8.2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n_{n0} \\) is the thermal-equilibrium concentration of majority carrier electrons in the n region.

Figure 8.3a shows a pn junction with an applied voltage \\( V_a \\). The electric field in the bulk p and n regions is normally very small. Essentially all of the applied voltage is across the junction region. The electric field \\( E_{app} \\), induced by the applied voltage, is in the opposite direction to the thermal-equilibrium space charge electric field, so the net electric field in the space charge region is reduced below the equilibrium value. The delicate balance between diffusion and the E-field force achieved at thermal equilibrium is upset. The electric field force that prevented majority carriers from crossing the space charge region is reduced; majority carrier electrons from the n side are now injected across the depletion region into the p material, and majority carrier holes from the p side are injected across the depletion region into the n material. As long as the bias \\( V_a \\) is applied, the injection of carriers across the space charge region continues and a current is created in the pn junction. This bias condition is known as forward bias; the energy-band diagram of the forward-biased pn junction is shown in Figure 8.3b.\n\nThe potential barrier \\( V_{bi} \\) in Equation (8.4) can be replaced by \\( (V_{bi} - V_a) \\) when the junction is forward biased. Equation (8.4) becomes\n\n\\[ n_p = n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-e(V_{bi} - V_a)}{kT} \\right) = n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{-eV_{bi}}{kT} \\right) \\exp \\left( \\frac{+eV_a}{kT} \\right) \\tag{8.5} \\]\n\nIf we assume low injection, the majority carrier electron concentration \\( n_{p0} \\), for example, does not change significantly. However, the minority carrier concentration, \\( n_p \\), can deviate from its thermal-equilibrium value \\( n_{p0} \\) by orders of magnitude. Using Equation (8.4), we can write Equation (8.5) as\n\n\\[ n_p = n_{p0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_a}{kT} \\right) \\tag{8.6} \\]\n\nWhen a forward-bias voltage is applied to the pn junction, the junction is no longer in thermal equilibrium. The left side of Equation (8.6) is the total minority carrier electron concentration in the p region, which is now greater than the thermal equilibrium value. The forward-bias voltage lowers the potential barrier so that majority carrier electrons from the n region are injected across the junction into the p region, thereby increasing the minority carrier electron concentration. We have produced excess minority carrier electrons in the p region.\n\nWhen the electrons are injected into the p region, these excess carriers are subject to the diffusion and recombination processes we discussed in Chapter 6. Equation (8.6), then, is the expression for the minority carrier electron concentration at the edge of the space charge region in the p region.\n\nExactly the same process occurs for majority carrier holes in the p region, which are injected across the space charge region into the n region under a forward-bias voltage.

The work functions of various metals are given in Table 9.1 and the electron affinities of several semiconductors are given in Table 9.2. In Figure 9.1a, we have assumed that \\(\\phi_m > \\phi_s\\). The ideal thermal-equilibrium metal-semiconductor energy-band diagram, for this situation, is shown in Figure 9.1b. Before contact, the Fermi level in the semiconductor was above that in the metal. In order for the Fermi level to become a constant through the system in thermal equilibrium, electrons from the semiconductor flow into the lower energy states in the metal. Positively charged donor atoms remain in the semiconductor, creating a space charge region.\n\nThe parameter \\(\\phi_{bn}\\) is the ideal barrier height of the semiconductor contact, the potential barrier seen by electrons in the metal trying to move into the semiconductor.

Because of this similarity, we expect the current\u2013voltage characteristics of the Schottky barrier junction to be similar to the exponential behavior of the pn junction diode. The current mechanism here, however, is due to the flow of majority carrier electrons. In forward bias, the barrier seen by the electrons in the semiconductor is reduced, so majority carrier electrons flow more easily from the semiconductor into the metal.

It is also more difficult to fabricate good ohmic contacts on wide-bandgap materials. In general, low barriers are not possible on these materials, so a heavily doped semiconductor at the surface must be used to form a tunneling contact. The formation of a tunneling junction requires diffusion, ion implantation, or perhaps epitaxial growth. The surface doping concentration in the semiconductor may be limited to the impurity solubility, which is approximately 5 \u00d7 10^19 cm^-3 for n-type GaAs.

The electron mobility will be much larger than if the electrons were in the same region as the ionized donors.\n\nThe movement of the electrons parallel to the interface will still be influenced by the coulomb attraction of the ionized impurities in the AlGaAs. The effect of these forces can be further reduced by using a graded AlGaAs-GaAs heterojunction. The graded layer is Al_xGa_1-xAs in which the mole fraction x varies with distance. In this case, an intrinsic layer of graded AlGaAs can be sandwiched between the N-type AlGaAs and the intrinsic GaAs.

The experimentally determined values of $\\Delta E_c$ and $\\Delta E_v$ may differ from the ideal values determined using the electron affinity rule. One possible explanation for this difference is that most heterojunctions have interface states. If we assume that the electrostatic potential is continuous through the junction, then the electric flux density will be discontinuous at the heterojunction due to the surface charge trapped in the interface states. The interface states will then change the energy-band diagram of the semiconductor heterojunction just as they changed the energy-band diagram of the metal-semiconductor junction. Another possible explanation for the deviation from the ideal is that as the two materials are brought together to form the heterojunction, the electron orbitals of each material begin to interact with each other, resulting in a transition region of a few angstroms at the interface. The energy bandgap is then continuous through this transition region and not a characteristic of either material.

A positive space charge region exists in the wide-bandgap material and an accumulation layer of electrons now exists at the interface in the narrow-bandgap material.

Since the energy-band diagram of a heterojunction is more complicated than that of a homojunction, we would expect the I\u2013V characteristics of the two junctions to differ.\n\nOne immediate difference between a homojunction and a heterojunction is in the barrier heights seen by the electrons and holes. Since the built-in potential barrier for electrons and holes in a homojunction is the same, the relative magnitude of the electron and hole currents is determined by the relative doping levels. In a heterojunction, the barrier heights seen by electrons and holes are not the same. The energy-band diagrams in Figures 9.18 and 9.23 demonstrate that the barrier heights for electrons and holes in a heterojunction can be significantly different. The barrier height for electrons in Figure 9.18 is larger than that for holes, so we would expect the current due to electrons to be insignificant compared to the hole current. If the barrier height for electrons is 0.2 eV larger than that for holes, the electron current will be approximately a factor of 10\u2074 smaller than the hole current, assuming all other parameters are equal. The opposite situation exists for the band diagram shown in Figure 9.23.\n\nThe conduction-band edge in Figure 9.23 and the valence-band edge in Figure 9.18 are somewhat similar to that of a rectifying metal\u2013semiconductor contact.

The barrier height can be increased or reduced by an applied potential across the junction as in the case of a pn homojunction or Schottky barrier junction. The heterojunction I\u2013V characteristics, however, may need to be modified to include diffusion effects and tunneling effects. Another complicating factor is that the effective mass of a carrier changes from one side of the junction to the other. Although the actual derivation of the I\u2013V relationship of the heterojunction is complex, the general form of the I\u2013V equation is still similar to that of a Schottky barrier diode and is generally dominated by one type of carrier."}, {"id": 372, "content": "# 9.4 SUMMARY\n\n- A metal on a lightly doped semiconductor can produce a rectifying contact that is known as a Schottky barrier diode. The ideal barrier height between the metal and semiconductor is the difference between the metal work function and the semiconductor electron affinity.\n- When a positive voltage is applied to an n-type semiconductor with respect to the metal (reverse bias), the barrier between the semiconductor and metal increases so that there is essentially no flow of charged carriers. When a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to an n-type semiconductor (forward bias), the barrier between the semiconductor and metal is lowered so that electrons can easily flow from the semiconductor into the metal by a process called thermionic emission.\n- The ideal current\u2013voltage relationship of the Schottky barrier diode is the same as that of the pn junction diode. However, since the current mechanism is different from that of the pn junction diode, the switching speed of the Schottky diode is faster. In addition, the reverse saturation current of the Schottky diode is larger than that of the pn junction diode, so a Schottky diode requires less forward bias voltage to achieve a given current compared to a pn junction diode.\n\n- Metal\u2013semiconductor junctions can also form ohmic contacts, which are low-resistance junctions providing conduction in both directions with very little voltage drop across the junction.\n\n- Semiconductor heterojunctions are formed between two semiconductor materials with different bandgap energies. One useful property of a heterojunction is the creation of a potential well at the interface.

The Fermi level at the surface is as far above the intrinsic level as the Fermi level is below the intrinsic level in the bulk semiconductor. The electron concentration at the surface is the same as the hole concentration in the bulk material. This condition is known as the threshold inversion point. The applied gate voltage creating this condition is known as the threshold voltage. If the gate voltage increases above this threshold value, the conduction band will bend slightly closer to the Fermi level, but the change in the conduction band at the surface is now only a slight function of gate voltage. The electron concentration at the surface, however, is an exponential function of the surface potential. The surface potential may increase by a few (kT/e) volts, which will change the electron concentration by orders of magnitude, but the space charge width changes only slightly. In this case, then, the space charge region has essentially reached a maximum width.\n\nThe maximum space charge width, $x_{dT}$, at this inversion transition point can be calculated from Equation (10.5) by setting $\\phi_b = 2\\phi_p$.

We have argued that a differential change in the capacitor voltage in the ideal case causes a differential change in the inversion layer charge density. However, we must consider the source of electrons that produces a change in the inversion charge density.\n\nThere are two sources of electrons that can change the charge density of the inversion layer. The first source is by diffusion of minority carrier electrons from the p-type substrate across the space charge region. This diffusion process is the same as that in a reverse-biased pn junction that generates the ideal reverse saturation current. The second source of electrons is by thermal generation of electron-hole pairs within the space charge region. This process is again the same as that in a reverse-biased pn junction generating the reverse-biased generation current. Both of these processes generate electrons at a particular rate. The electron concentration in the inversion layer, then, cannot change instantaneously. If the ac voltage across the MOS capacitor changes rapidly, the change in the inversion layer charge will not be able to respond. The C-V characteristics will then be a function of the frequency of the ac signal used to measure the capacitance.\n\nIn the limit of a very high frequency, the inversion layer charge will not respond to a differential change in capacitor voltage. Figure 10.28 shows the charge distribution in the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate. At a high-signal frequency, the differential change in charge occurs at the metal and in the space charge width in the semiconductor. The capacitance of the MOS capacitor is then C_min, which we discussed earlier.\n\nThe high-frequency and low-frequency limits of the C-V characteristics are shown in Figure 10.29. In general, high frequency corresponds to a value on the order of 1 MHz and low frequency corresponds to values in the range of 5 to 100 Hz. Typically, the high-frequency characteristics of the MOS capacitor are measured.![Graph showing differential charge distribution at inversion for a high-frequency differential change in gate voltage.](image.png)"}, {"id": 401, "content": "### 10.2.3 Fixed Oxide and Interface Charge Effects\n\nIn all of the discussion concerning C-V characteristics so far, we have assumed an ideal oxide in which there are no fixed oxide or oxide-semiconductor interface charges. These two types of charges will change the C-V characteristics.\n\nWe previously discussed how the fixed oxide charge affects the threshold voltage. This charge will also affect the flat-band voltage. The flat-band voltage from Equation (10.25) is given by\n\n$$V_{FB} = \\phi_{ms} - \\frac{Q'_{ox}}{C_{ox}}$$\n\nwhere $Q'_{ox}$ is the equivalent fixed oxide charge and $\\phi_{ms}$ is the metal-semiconductor work function difference.

Since the oxide charge is not a function of gate voltage, the curves![Figure 10.30](https://via.placeholder.com/150)"}, {"id": 403, "content": "**Figure 10.31** | Schematic diagram showing interface states at the oxide\u2013semiconductor interface.\n\nshow a parallel shift with oxide charge, and the shape of the C\u2013V curves remains the same as the ideal characteristics. Figure 10.30 shows the high-frequency characteristics of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for several values of fixed positive oxide charge.\n\nThe C\u2013V characteristics can be used to determine the equivalent fixed oxide charge. For a given MOS structure, \u03c6\u0304\u2080 and C\u2092\u2093 are known, so the ideal flat-band voltage and flat-band capacitance can be calculated. The experimental value of flat-band voltage can be measured from the C\u2013V curve, and the value of fixed oxide charge can then be determined. The C\u2013V measurements are a valuable diagnostic tool to characterize a MOS device. This characterization is especially useful in the study of radiation effects on MOS devices, for example.\n\nWe first encountered oxide\u2013semiconductor interface states in Chapter 9 in the discussion of Schottky barrier diodes. Figure 10.31 shows the energy-band diagram of a semiconductor at the oxide\u2013semiconductor interface. The periodic nature of the semiconductor is abruptly terminated at the interface so that allowed electronic energy levels will exist within the forbidden bandgap. These allowed energy states are referred to as interface states. Charge can flow between the semiconductor and interface states, in contrast to the fixed oxide charge. The net charge in these interface states is a function of the position of the Fermi level in the bandgap.\n\nIn general, acceptor states exist in the upper half of the bandgap and donor states exist in the lower half of the bandgap. An acceptor state is neutral if the Fermi level is below the state and becomes negatively charged if the Fermi level is above the state. A donor state is neutral if the Fermi level is above the state and becomes positively charged if the Fermi level is below the state. The charge of the interface states is then a function of the gate voltage applied across the MOS capacitor.\n\nFigure 10.32a shows the energy-band diagram in a p-type semiconductor of a MOS capacitor biased in the accumulation condition. In this case, there is a net positive charge trapped in the donor states. Now let the gate voltage change to produce the energy-band diagram shown in Figure 10.32b.

Implicit in the enhancement mode notation is the idea that the semiconductor substrate is not inverted directly under the oxide with zero gate voltage. A positive gate voltage induces the electron inversion layer, which then \u201cconnects\u201d the n-type source and the n-type drain regions. The source terminal is the source of carriers that flow through the channel to the drain terminal. For this n-channel device, electrons flow from the source to the drain so the conventional current will enter the drain and leave the source. The conventional circuit symbol for this n-channel enhancement mode device is also shown in the figure.\n\n**Figure 10.35** shows an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET. An n-channel region exists under the oxide with 0 V applied to the gate. However, we have shown that the threshold voltage of a MOS device with a p-type substrate may be negative; this means that an electron inversion layer already exists with zero gate voltage applied. Such a device is also considered to be a depletion mode device. The n-channel shown in the figure can be an electron inversion layer or an intentionally doped n region. The conventional circuit symbol for the n-channel depletion mode MOSFET is also shown in the figure.\n\n**Figures 10.36a, b** show a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and a p-channel depletion mode MOSFET. In the p-channel enhancement mode device, a negative gate voltage must be applied to create an inversion layer of holes that will \u201cconnect\u201d the p-type source and drain regions.

The source and substrate, or body, terminals are held at ground potential. With this bias configuration, there is no electron inversion layer, the drain-to-substrate pn junction is reverse biased, and the drain current is zero (disregarding pn junction leakage currents).\n\n<|begin_image|>![Cross section and circuit symbol for (a) a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and (b) a p-channel depletion mode MOSFET.](image.png)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 10.36** | Cross section and circuit symbol for (a) a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and (b) a p-channel depletion mode MOSFET.\n\n**Figure 10.37b** shows the same MOSFET with an applied gate voltage such that V_GS > V_T. An electron inversion layer has been created so that when a small drain voltage is applied, the electrons in the inversion layer will flow from the source to the positive drain terminal. The conventional current enters the drain terminal and leaves the source terminal. In this ideal case, there is no current through the oxide to the gate terminal.\n\nFor small V_DS values, the channel region has the characteristics of a resistor, so we can write\n\nI_D = g_d V_DS (10.41)\n\nwhere g_d is defined as the channel conductance in the limit as V_DS \u2192 0.

The inversion layer charge is a function of the gate voltage; thus, the basic MOS transistor action is the modulation of the channel conductance by the gate voltage. The channel conductance, in turn, determines the drain current. We will initially assume that the mobility is a constant; we will discuss mobility effects and variations in the next chapter.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 10.37](image1.png)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 10.37** | The n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET (a) with an applied gate voltage V_GS < V_T and (b) with an applied gate voltage V_GS > V_T.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 10.38](image2.png)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 10.38** | I_D versus V_DS characteristics for small values of V_DS at three V_GS voltages.\n\n**Figure 10.39a** shows the basic MOS structure for the case when V_GS > V_T and the applied V_DS voltage is small.

As the drain voltage increases, the voltage drop across the oxide near the drain terminal decreases, which means that the induced inversion charge density near the drain also decreases. The incremental conductance of the channel at the drain decreases, which then means that the slope of the I_D versus V_DS curve will decrease. This effect is shown in the I_D versus V_DS curve in the figure.\n\nWhen V_DS increases to the point where the potential drop across the oxide at the drain terminal is equal to V_T, the induced inversion charge density is zero at the drain terminal. This effect is schematically shown in Figure 10.39c. At this point, the incremental conductance at the drain is zero, which means that the slope of the I_D versus V_DS curve is zero. We can write\n\n$$V_{GS} - V_{DS}(sat) = V_T$$\n\nor\n\n$$V_{DS}(sat) = V_{GS} - V_T$$\n\nwhere V_DS(sat) is the drain-to-source voltage producing zero inversion charge density at the drain terminal.\n\nWhen V_DS becomes larger than the V_DS(sat) value, the point in the channel at which the inversion charge is just zero moves toward the source terminal. In this case, electrons enter the channel at the source, travel through the channel toward the drain, and then, at the point where the charge goes to zero, the electrons are injected into the space charge region where they are swept by the E-field to the drain contact. If we assume that the change in channel length \u0394L is small compared to the original length L, then the drain current will be a constant for V_DS > V_DS(sat).

We may also consider the case when the n-channel region is actually an n-type semiconductor region. In this type of device, a negative gate voltage will induce a space charge region under the oxide, reducing the thickness of the n-channel region. The reduced thickness decreases the channel conductance, which reduces the drain current. A positive gate voltage will create an electron accumulation layer, which increases the drain current. One basic requirement for this device is that the channel thickness t must be less than the maximum induced space charge width in order to be able to turn the device off.

However, there is one MOS technology that is used extensively, for which the basic fabrication techniques must be considered in order to understand essential characteristics of these devices and circuits. The MOS technology we consider briefly is the complementary MOS, or CMOS, process.\n\nWe have considered the physics of both n-channel and p-channel enhancement mode MOSFETs. Both devices are used in a CMOS inverter, which is the basis of CMOS digital logic circuits. The dc power dissipation in a digital circuit can be reduced to very low levels by using a complementary p-channel and n-channel pair.\n\nIt is necessary to form electrically isolated p- and n-substrate regions in an integrated circuit to accommodate the n- and p-channel transistors. The p-well process has been a commonly used technique for CMOS circuits. The process starts with a fairly low doped n-type silicon substrate in which the p-channel MOSFET will be fabricated. A diffused p region, called a p well, is formed in which the n-channel MOSFET will be fabricated. In most cases, the p-type substrate doping level must be larger than the n-type substrate doping level to obtain the desired threshold voltages. The larger p doping can easily compensate the initial n doping to form the p well. A simplified cross section of the p-well CMOS structure is shown in Figure 10.58a. The notation FOX stands for field oxide, which is a relatively thick oxide separating the devices. The FOX prevents either the n or p substrate from becoming inverted and helps maintain isolation between the two devices. In practice, additional processing steps must be included; for example, providing connections so that the p well and n substrate can be electrically connected to the appropriate voltages. The n substrate must always be at a higher potential than the p well; therefore, this pn junction will always be reverse biased.\n\n<|begin_image|>\n![Figure 10.58 | CMOS structures: (a) p well, (b) n well, and (c) twin well.](image_url)\n\n*The text continues with a description of the images in Figure 10.58:*\n\n(a) The p well structure shows a p well formed in an n substrate. The p well is surrounded by field oxide (FOX) to isolate it from the n substrate. The p well contains the p-channel MOSFETs, and the n substrate contains the n-channel MOSFETs.\n\n(b) The n well structure shows an n well formed in a p substrate. The n well is surrounded by field oxide (FOX) to isolate it from the p substrate.

The p well and n well are surrounded by field oxide (FOX) to isolate them from the substrate. This structure allows for the fabrication of both p-channel and n-channel MOSFETs in the same well, providing flexibility in circuit design.\n\n*Source: From Yang [22].*\n\nWith ion implantation now being extensively used for threshold voltage control, both the n-well CMOS process and twin-well CMOS process can be used. The n-well CMOS process, shown in Figure 10.58b, starts with an optimized p-type substrate that is used to form the n-channel MOSFETs. (The n-channel MOSFETs, in general, have superior characteristics, so this starting point should yield excellent n-channel devices.) The n well is then added, in which the p-channel devices are fabricated. The n-well doping can be controlled by ion implantation.\n\nThe twin-well CMOS process, shown in Figure 10.58c, allows both the p-well and n-well regions to be optimally doped to control the threshold voltage and transconductance of each transistor. The twin-well process allows a higher packing density because of self-aligned channel stops.\n\nOne major problem in CMOS circuits has been latch-up. Latch-up refers to a high-current, low-voltage condition that may occur in a four-layer pnpn structure. Figure 10.59a shows the circuit of a CMOS inverter and Figure 10.59b shows a simplified integrated circuit layout of the inverter circuit. In the CMOS layout, p+ source to n+ substrate to p well to n+ source forms such a four-layer structure.\n\n<|begin_image|>\n![Figure 10.59 | (a) Circuit of a CMOS inverter. (b) Simplified integrated circuit layout of the inverter circuit.](image_url)\n\nThe equivalent circuit of this four-layer structure is shown in Figure 10.60. The silicon-controlled rectifier action involves the interaction of the parasitic pnp and npn bipolar transistors. Bipolar transistors are discussed in Chapter 12. The npn transistor corresponds to the vertical n+ source to p-well to n-substrate structure and the pnp transistor corresponds to the lateral p-well to n-substrate to p+ source structure. Under normal CMOS operation, both parasitic bipolar transistors are cut off. However, under certain conditions, avalanche breakdown may occur in the p-well to n-substrate junction, driving both bipolar transistors into saturation. This high-current, low-voltage condition\u2014latch-up\u2014can sustain itself by positive feedback. The condition can prevent the CMOS circuit from operating and can also cause permanent damage and burnout of the circuit.\n\nLatch-up can be prevented if the product \\(\\beta_n \\beta_p\\) is less than unity at all times, where \\(\\beta_n\\) and \\(\\beta_p\\) are the common-emitter current gains of the npn and pnp parasitic transistors."}, {"id": 427, "content": "**Figure 10.59**\n(a) CMOS inverter circuit.\n(b) Simplified integrated circuit cross section of CMOS inverter.\n\n![Figure 10.60](image_url)\n\n**Figure 10.60**\n(a) The splitting of the basic pnpn structure.\n(b) The two-transistor equivalent circuit of the four-layered pnpn device.\n\nbipolar transistors, respectively. One method of preventing latch-up is to \u201ckill\u201d the minority carrier lifetime. Minority carrier lifetime degradation can be accomplished by gold doping or neutron irradiation, either of which introduces deep traps within the semiconductor. The deep traps increase the excess minority carrier recombination rate and reduce current gain. A second method of preventing latch-up is by using proper circuit layout techniques. If the two bipolar transistors can be effectively decoupled, then latch-up can be minimized or prevented. The two parasitic bipolar transistors can also be decoupled by using a different fabrication technology. The silicon-on-insulator technology, for example, allows the n-channel and the p-channel MOSFETs to be isolated from each other by an insulator. This isolation decouples the parasitic bipolar transistors."}, {"id": 428, "content": "### 10.6 | SUMMARY\n\n- The fundamental physics and characteristics of the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) have been considered in this chapter.\n- The heart of the MOSFET is the MOS capacitor.

The bulk p-substrate is assumed to be at zero potential. Figure 11.3b, c shows the accumulation and weak inversion cases. There is a potential barrier between the n\u207a source and channel region which the electrons must overcome in order to generate a channel current. A comparison of these barriers with those in pn junctions would suggest that the channel current is an exponential function of V\u209a\u209b. In the inversion mode, shown in Figure 11.3d, the barrier is so small that we lose the exponential dependence, since the junction is more like an ohmic contact.\n\nThe actual derivation of the subthreshold current is beyond the scope of this chapter. We can write that\n\n$$I_D(\\text{sub}) \\approx \\left[ \\exp \\left( \\frac{eV_{GS}}{kT} \\right) \\right] \\cdot \\left[ 1 - \\exp \\left( \\frac{-eV_{DS}}{kT} \\right) \\right] \\tag{11.1}$$\n\nIf V\u209a\u209b is larger than a few (kT/e) volts, then the subthreshold current is independent of V\u209a\u209b.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 11.4<|end_image|> shows the exponential behavior of the subthreshold current for several body-to-source voltages. Also shown on the curves are the threshold voltage values. Ideally, a change in gate voltage on approximately 60 mV produces an order of magnitude change in the subthreshold current. A detailed analysis of the subthreshold condition shows that the slope of the I_D versus V\u209a\u209b curve is a function of the semiconductor doping and is also a function of the interface state density. The\n\nmeasurement of the slope of these curves has been used to experimentally determine the oxide\u2013semiconductor interface state density.\n\nIf a MOSFET is biased at or even slightly below the threshold voltage, the drain current is not zero. The subthreshold current may add significantly to power dissipation in a large-scale integrated circuit in which hundreds or thousands of MOSFETs are used.

However, when the MOSFET is biased in the saturation region, the depletion region at the drain terminal extends laterally into the channel, reducing the effective channel length. Since the depletion region width is bias dependent, the effective channel length is also bias dependent and is modulated by the drain-to-source voltage.

However, this assumption must be modified for two reasons. The first effect to be considered is the variation in mobility with gate voltage. The second reason for a mobility variation is that the effective carrier mobility decreases as the carrier approaches the velocity saturation limit. This effect is discussed in the next section.\n\nThe inversion layer charge is induced by a vertical electric field, which is shown in Figure 11.8 for an n-channel device. A positive gate voltage produces a force on the electrons in the inversion layer toward the surface. As the electrons travel through the channel toward the drain, they are attracted to the surface, but then are repelled by localized coulombic forces. This effect, schematically shown in Figure 11.9, is called surface scattering. The surface scattering effect reduces mobility. If there is a positive fixed oxide charge near the oxide-semiconductor interface, the mobility will be further reduced due to the additional coulomb interaction.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Image](image_url)\n\n**Figure 11.8** Vertical electric field in an n-channel MOSFET.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Image](image_url)\n\n**Figure 11.9** Schematic of carrier surface scattering effects.\n\nThe relationship between the inversion charge mobility and the transverse electric field is usually measured experimentally.

In this ideal case, the carrier velocity increases until the ideal current is attained. However, we have seen that the carrier velocity saturates with increasing electric field. Velocity saturation will become more prominent in shorter-channel devices since the corresponding horizontal electric field is generally larger.\n\nIn the ideal I-V relationship, current saturation occurs when the inversion charge density becomes zero at the drain terminal, or when\n\n$$V_{DS} = V_{DS}(\\text{sat}) = V_{GS} - V_T$$\n\nfor the n-channel MOSFET. However, velocity saturation can change this saturation condition. Velocity saturation will occur when the horizontal electric field is approximately 10^4 V/cm. If $V_{DS} = 5$ V in a device with a channel length of $L = 1$ \u03bcm, the average electric field is $5 \\times 10^4$ V/cm. Velocity saturation, then, is very likely to occur in short-channel devices.\n\nThe modified $I_D(\\text{sat})$ characteristics are described approximately by\n\n$$I_D(\\text{sat}) = WC_{ox}(V_{GS} - V_T)v_{sat}$$\n\nwhere $v_{sat}$ is the saturation velocity (approximately 10^7 cm/s for electrons in bulk silicon) and $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per cm^2. The saturation velocity will decrease somewhat with applied gate voltage because of the vertical electric field and surface scattering. Velocity saturation will yield an $I_D(\\text{sat})$ value smaller than that predicted by the ideal relation, and it will yield a smaller $V_{GS}(\\text{sat})$ value than predicted. The $I_D(\\text{sat})$ current is also approximately linear with $V_{GS}$, instead of having the ideal square law dependence predicted previously.\n\nThere are several models of mobility versus electric field. One particular relation that is commonly used is\n\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{eff}}{\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{eff}E}{V_{sat}}\\right)^2\\right]^{1/2}}$$\n\nFigure 11.11 shows a comparison of drain current versus drain-to-source voltage characteristics for constant mobility and for field-dependent mobility.

The average drift velocity is a function of the mean time between collisions or the mean distance between scattering events. In the long-channel device, the channel length L is much longer than the mean distance between collisions l, so that an average carrier drift velocity exists. As the MOSFET channel length is reduced, the mean distance between collisions l may become comparable to L so that the previous analysis may not be valid. If the channel length is further reduced so that L < l, then a large fraction of carriers could travel from the source to the drain without experiencing a scattering event. This motion of carriers is called ballistic transport.\n\nBallistic transport means that carriers travel faster than the average drift velocity or the saturation velocity, and this effect can lead to very fast devices. Ballistic transport occurs in submicron (L < 1 \u03bcm) devices. As the MOSFET technology continues to shrink the channel length toward the 0.1 \u03bcm value, the ballistic transport phenomenon will become more important.\n\n---\n\n**TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING**\n\n**TYU 11.1** Consider a MOSFET biased in the subthreshold region with V_D >> kT/e.

There has been reluctance, for example, to change standardized power supply levels that have been used in circuits earlier. In addition, other factors that do not scale, such as threshold voltage and subthreshold currents, have made the reduction in applied voltages less desirable. As a consequence, electric fields in MOS devices have tended to increase as device dimensions shrank.\n\nConsequences of increased electric fields are reduced reliability and increased power density. As the power density increases, the device temperature may increase. Increased temperature may affect the device reliability. As the oxide thickness is reduced and the electric field is increased, gate oxides are closer to breakdown and oxide integrity may be more difficult to maintain. In addition, direct tunneling of carriers through the oxide may be more likely to occur. Increased electric fields may also increase the chances of hot-electron effects, which are discussed later in this chapter.

However, if the electric field in the oxide becomes large enough, breakdown can occur, which can lead to a catastrophic failure. In silicon dioxide, the electric field at breakdown is on the order of 6 \u00d7 10^6 V/cm. This breakdown field is larger than that in silicon, but the gate oxides are also quite thin. A gate voltage of approximately 30 V would produce breakdown in an oxide with a thickness of 500 \u00c5. However, a safety margin of a factor of 3 is common, so that the maximum safe gate voltage with t_ox = 500 \u00c5 would be 10 V. A safety margin is necessary since there may be defects in the oxide that lower the breakdown field. Oxide breakdown is normally not a serious problem except in power devices and ultrathin oxide devices. Other oxide degradation problems are discussed later in this chapter.\n\n#### Avalanche Breakdown\n\nAvalanche breakdown may occur by impact ionization in the space charge region near the drain terminal. We have considered avalanche breakdown in pn junctions in Chapter 7. In an ideal planar one-sided pn junction, breakdown is a function primarily of the doping concentration in the low-doped region of the junction. For the MOSFET, the low-doped region corresponds to the semiconductor substrate. If a p-type substrate doping is N_a = 3 \u00d7 10^16 cm^-3, for example, the pn junction breakdown voltage would be approximately 25 V for a planar junction. However, the n+ drain contact may be a fairly shallow diffused region with <|begin_image|>![Graph showing a curve](image1.png)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 11.21** Curvature effect on the electric field in the drain junction.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Graph showing a curve](image2.png)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 11.22** Current\u2013voltage characteristic showing the snapback breakdown effect.\n\na large curvature. The electric field in the depletion region tends to be concentrated at the curvature, which lowers the breakdown voltage. This curvature effect is shown in Figure 11.21.\n\n**Near Avalanche and Snapback Breakdown<sup>1</sup>** Another breakdown mechanism results in the S-shaped breakdown curve shown in Figure 11.22.

The n(source)-p(substrate)-n(drain) structure also forms a parasitic bipolar transistor. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 11.23b.\n\nFigure 11.24 shows the device when avalanche breakdown is just beginning in the space charge region near the drain. We tend to think of the avalanche breakdown suddenly occurring at a particular voltage. However, avalanche breakdown is a gradual process that starts at low current levels and for electric fields somewhat below the breakdown field. The electrons generated by the avalanche process flow into the drain and contribute to the drain current. The avalanche-generated holes generally flow through the substrate to the body terminal. Since the substrate has a nonzero resistance, a voltage drop is produced as shown. This potential difference drives the source-to-substrate pn junction into forward bias near the source terminal. The source is heavily doped n-type; thus, a large number of electrons can be injected from the source contact into the substrate under forward bias. This process becomes\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 11.24](image3.png)<|end_image|> <|begin_image|>![Figure 11.24](image4.png)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 11.24** (a) Substrate current\u2013induced voltage drop caused by avalanche multiplication at the drain. (b) Currents in the parasitic bipolar transistor. severe as the voltage drop in the substrate approaches 0.6 to 0.7 V. A fraction of the injected electrons diffuses across the parasitic base region into the reverse-biased drain space charge region where they also add to the drain current.\n\nThe avalanche breakdown process is a function of not only the electric field but the number of carriers involved. The rate of avalanche breakdown increases as the number of carriers in the drain space charge region increases. We now have a regenerative or positive feedback mechanism. Avalanche breakdown near the drain terminal produces the substrate current, which produces the forward-biased source-substrate pn junction voltage. The forward-biased junction injects carriers that can diffuse back to the drain and increase the avalanche process. The positive feedback produces an unstable system.\n\nThe snapback or negative resistance portion of the curve shown in Figure 11.22 can now be explained by using the parasitic bipolar transistor. The potential of the base of the bipolar transistor near the emitter (source) is almost floating, since this voltage is determined primarily by the avalanche-generated substrate current rather than an externally applied voltage.\n\nFor the open-base bipolar transistor shown in Figure 11.24, we can write\n\n$$I_c = \\alpha I_e + I_{Cbo}$$\n\n(11.36)\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the common base current gain and \\(I_{Cbo}\\) is the base-collector leakage current. For an open base, \\(I_c = I_e\\), so Equation (11.36) becomes\n\n$$I_c = \\alpha I_c + I_{Cbo}$$\n\n(11.37)\n\nAt breakdown, the current in the B-C junction is multiplied by the multiplication factor \\(M\\), so we have\n\n$$I_c = M(\\alpha I_c + I_{Cbo})$$\n\n(11.38)\n\nSolving for \\(I_c\\) we obtain\n\n$$I_c = \\frac{M I_{Cbo}}{1 - \\alpha M}$$\n\n(11.39)\n\nBreakdown is defined as the condition that produces \\(I_c \\rightarrow \\infty\\). For a single reverse-biased pn junction, \\(M \\rightarrow \\infty\\) at breakdown. However, from Equation (11.39), breakdown is now defined to be the condition when \\(\\alpha M \\rightarrow 1\\) or, for the open-base condition, breakdown occurs when \\(M \\rightarrow 1/\\alpha\\), which is a much lower multiplication factor than for the simple pn junction.\n\nAn empirical relation for the multiplication factor is usually written as"}, {"id": 457, "content": "### Avalanche Breakdown\n\n$$M = \\frac{1}{1 - (V_{CE}/V_{BD})^m}$$\n\n(11.40)\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is an empirical constant in the range of 3 to 6 and \\(V_{BD}\\) is the junction breakdown voltage.\n\nThe common base current gain factor \\(\\alpha\\) is a strong function of collector current for small values of collector current. This effect will be discussed in Chapter 12 on bipolar transistors. At low currents, the recombination current in the B-E junction is a significant fraction of the total current so that the common base current gain is small. As the collector current increases, the value of \u03b1 increases. As avalanche breakdown begins and I_C is small, particular values of M and V_CE are required to produce the condition of \u03b1M = 1. As the collector current increases, \u03b1 increases; therefore, smaller values of M and V_CE are required to produce the avalanche breakdown condition. The snapback, or negative resistance, breakdown characteristic is then produced.\n\nOnly a fraction of the injected electrons from the forward-biased source-substrate junction are collected by the drain terminal. A more exact calculation of the snapback characteristic would necessarily involve taking into account this fraction; thus, the simple model would need to be modified. However, the above discussion qualitatively describes the snapback effect. The snapback effect can be minimized by using a heavily doped substrate that will prevent any significant voltage drop from being developed. A thin epitaxial p-type layer with the proper doping concentration to produce the required threshold voltage can be grown on a heavily doped substrate."}, {"id": 458, "content": "### Near Punch-Through Effects\n\nPunch-through is the condition at which the drain-to-substrate space charge region extends completely across the channel region to the source-to-substrate space charge region. In this situation, the barrier between the source and drain is completely eliminated and a very large drain current would exist.\n\nHowever, the drain current will begin to increase rapidly before the actual punch-through condition is reached. This characteristic is referred to as the near punch-through condition, also known as Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL). <|begin_image|>Figure 11.25a<|end_image|> shows the ideal energy-band diagram from source to drain for a long n-channel MOSFET for the case when V_GS < V_T and when the drain-to-source voltage is relatively small.

As the channel length becomes smaller, the bias voltages may not be scaled down accordingly, so the junction electric fields become larger. As the electric field increases, near avalanche breakdown and near punch-through effects become more serious. In addition, as device geometries are scaled down, the parasitic bipolar device becomes more dominant and breakdown effects are enhanced.\n\nOne approach that reduces these breakdown effects is to alter the doping profile of the drain contact. The **Lightly Doped Drain (LDD)** design and doping profiles are shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 11.27a<|end_image|>, the conventional MOSFET and doping profiles are shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 11.27b<|end_image|> for comparison. By introducing the lightly doped region, the peak electric field in the space charge region is reduced and the breakdown effects are minimized. The peak electric field at the drain junction is a function of the semiconductor doping as well as the curvature of the n+ drain region. <|begin_image|>Figure 11.28<|end_image|> shows the physical geometries of a conventional n+ drain contact and an LDD structure superimposed on the same plot. The magnitude of the electric field at the oxide\u2013semiconductor interface in the LDD structure is less than in the conventional structure. The electric field in the conventional device peaks approximately at the metallurgical junction and drops quickly to zero in the drain because no field can exist in the highly conductive n+ region. On the other hand, the electric field in the LDD device extends across the n-region before dropping to zero at the drain. This effect minimizes breakdown and the hot electron effects, which we discuss in Section 11.5.3.\nTwo disadvantages of the LDD device are an increase in both fabrication complexity and drain resistance. The added processing steps, however, produce a device with significant improvements in performance. The cross section of the LDD device <|begin_image|>![Figure 11.27](image1.png)<|end_image|> indicates a lightly doped n region at the source terminal also. The inclusion of this region does not improve device performance, but does reduce the fabrication complexity as much as possible. The added series resistance increases power dissipation in the device; this must be taken into account in high-power devices.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 11.28](image2.png)<|end_image|> Magnitude of the electric field at the Si-SiO2 interface as a function of distance; V_DS = 10 V.

Although all of these parameters may be fixed in a particular design and fabrication process, the resulting threshold voltage may not be acceptable for all applications. Ion implantation can be used to change and adjust the substrate doping near the oxide\u2013semiconductor surface to provide the desired threshold voltage. In addition, ion implantation is used for more than doping the channel. It is used extensively as a standard part of device fabrication; for example, it is used to form the source and drain regions of the transistor.\n\nTo change the doping and thereby change the threshold voltage, a precise, controlled number of either donor or acceptor ions are implanted into the semiconductor near the oxide surface. When an MOS device is biased in either depletion or inversion and when the implanted dopant atoms are within the induced space charge region, then the ionized dopant charge adds to (or subtracts from) the maximum space charge density, which controls the threshold voltage. An implant of acceptor ions into either a p\u2013 or n-type substrate will shift the threshold voltage to more positive values, while an implant of donor ions will shift the threshold voltage to more negative values. Ion implantation can be carried out to change a depletion-mode device to enhancement-mode or an enhancement-mode device to depletion-mode, which is an important application of this technology.\n\nAs a first approximation, assume that D<sub>i</sub> acceptor atoms per cm<sup>2</sup> are implanted into a p-type substrate directly adjacent to the oxide\u2013semiconductor interface as shown in Figure 11.29a.

It has been found that generated electrons in the oxide are fairly mobile, with a mobility value on the order of 20 cm^2/V-s. At high electric fields, the electron velocity in the oxide also saturates at approximately 10^7 cm/s, so that the electron transit time for typical gate oxide thicknesses is on the order of a few picoseconds.

The hole transport process is dispersive in time and is a function of the electric field, temperature, and oxide thickness. The effective hole mobility in silicon dioxide is typically in the range of 10^-4 to 10^-11 cm^2/V-s; thus, holes are relatively immobile when compared with electrons.\n\nWhen holes reach the silicon-silicon dioxide (Si-SiO2) interface, a fraction are captured in trapping sites while the remainder flow into the silicon. A net positive radiation-induced charge is then trapped in the oxide due to these captured holes. This trapped charge can last from hours to years. As we have seen, a positive oxide charge causes a negative shift in threshold voltage.\n\nThe measured areal hole trap densities are in the range of 10^12 to 10^15 cm^-2 depending upon oxide and device processing. In general, these traps are located within approximately 50 \u00c5 of the Si-SiO2 interface. The hole trap is usually associated with a trivalent silicon defect that has an oxygen vacancy in the SiO2 structure. The oxygen vacancies are located in a silicon-rich region near the Si-SiO2 interface.\n\nSince the threshold or flat-band voltage shift is a function of the amount of trapped charge, the voltage shift is a function of applied voltage across the oxide.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 11.31<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 11.31 | Radiation-induced flat-band voltage shift in an MOS capacitor as a function of applied gate bias during irradiation.**\n\n*(From Ma and Dressendorfer [7].)*\n\nFor small values of gate voltage, some radiation-generated holes and electrons recombine in the oxide. Hence, the amount of charge reaching the Si-SiO2 interface and being trapped is less than for a large positive gate voltage, where essentially all radiation-generated holes reach the interface without recombining with electrons. If the fraction of generated holes that become trapped is relatively constant, then the voltage shift becomes independent of positive gate bias, as shown in the figure. For negative applied gate voltages, the radiation-induced holes move toward the gate terminal. There can be positive charge trapping in the oxide near the gate, but the effect of this trapped charge on the threshold voltage is small.\n\n**Objective:** Calculate the threshold voltage shift due to radiation-induced oxide charge trapping. **EXAMPLE 11.7**\n\nConsider a MOS device with an oxide thickness of \\( t_{ox} = 25 \\text{ nm} = 250 \\text{ A} \\). Assume that a pulse of ionizing radiation creates \\( 10^{14} \\) electron\u2013hole pairs per cm\\(^3\\) in the oxide. Also assume that the electrons are swept out through the gate terminal with zero recombination, and that 20 percent of the generated holes are trapped at the oxide\u2013semiconductor interface.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe areal density of holes generated in the oxide is\n\n\\[ N_{h} = (10^{14})(250 \\times 10^{-8}) = 2.5 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}^{-2} \\]\n\nThe equivalent trapped surface charge is then\n\n\\[ Q'_{ox} = (2.5 \\times 10^{12})(0.2)(1.6 \\times 10^{-19}) = 8 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2 \\]\n\nWe find\n\n\\[ C_{ox} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}} = \\frac{3.9(8.85 \\times 10^{-14})}{250 \\times 10^{-8}} = 1.381 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ F/cm}^2 \\]\n\nThe threshold voltage shift is then\n\n\\[ \\Delta V_T = -\\frac{Q'_{ox}}{C_{ox}} = -\\frac{8 \\times 10^{-8}}{1.381 \\times 10^{-7}} = -0.579 \\text{ V} \\]\n\n### Comment\n\nAs we have seen previously, a positive fixed oxide charge shifts the threshold voltage in the negative voltage direction. The ionizing radiation may shift an enhancement-mode device into the depletion mode.\n\n### EXERCISE PROBLEM\n\n**Ex 11.7** Repeat Example 11.7 for a MOS device with an oxide thickness of (a) \\( t_{ox} = 12 \\text{ nm} = 120 \\text{ A} \\) and (b) \\( t_{ox} = 8 \\text{ nm} = 80 \\text{ A} \\). (c) What can be said about the shift in threshold voltage as the oxide thickness decreases?\n\n\\[ [uqs.ss9] (a) : \\text{A \u00c96S0 0} = /A \\nabla (q) : \\text{A \u00c91 0} = /A \\nabla (b) : \\text{suv} \\]\n\nOne failure mechanism, therefore, caused by the radiation-induced oxide charge in an n-channel MOSFET in an integrated circuit is a shift from enhancement mode to depletion mode. The device will be turned on rather than off at zero gate voltage; consequently, the circuit function may be disrupted or an excessive power supply current may be generated in the circuit.\n\nThe gate voltage in a p-channel MOSFET is normally negative with respect to the substrate. Radiation-generated holes in the oxide are forced to the gate\u2013oxide interface. The trapped charge in this region has less effect on the threshold voltage, so threshold shifts in p-channel MOSFETs are normally smaller if the trap concentrations at the gate\u2013oxide and oxide\u2013semiconductor interfaces are of the same order of magnitude."}, {"id": 468, "content": "## 11.5.2 Radiation-Induced Interface States\n\nWe have considered the effect of interface states on the C\u2013V characteristics of an MOS capacitor and on the MOSFET characteristics. The net charge in the interface states of an n-channel MOS device at the threshold inversion point is negative. This negative charge causes a shift in threshold voltage in the positive voltage direction, which is opposite to the shift due to the positive oxide charge. In addition, since the interface states can be charged, they are another source of coulomb interaction with the inversion charge carrier, which means that the inversion carrier mobility is a function of the interface state density through surface-scattering effects. Interface states, then, affect both threshold voltage and carrier mobility.\n\nWhen MOS devices are exposed to ionizing radiation, additional interface states are generated at the Si\u2013SiO2 interface. The radiation-induced interface states tend to be donor states in the lower half of the bandgap and acceptor states in the upper half.\n\n**Figure 11.32** shows the threshold voltage in an n-channel and a p-channel MOSFET as a function of ionizing radiation dose. We initially see the negative threshold voltage shift in both devices due to the radiation-induced positive oxide charge. The reversal in threshold shift at the higher dose levels is attributable to the creation of radiation-induced interface states that tend to compensate the radiation-induced positive oxide charge."}, {"id": 469, "content": "**11.6 | SUMMARY**\n\n- Advanced concepts of MOSFETs have been discussed in this chapter.\n- Subthreshold conduction means that the drain current in a MOSFET is not zero even when the gate-to-source voltage is less than the threshold voltage. In this situation, the transistor is biased in the weak inversion mode and the drain current is dominated by the diffusion rather than the drift mechanism.\n- The effective channel length decreases with an increase in drain voltage when the MOSFET is biased in the saturation region, since the depletion region at the drain extends into the channel. This effect is known as channel length modulation.\n- The mobility of carriers in the inversion layer is not a constant. As the gate voltage increases, the transverse electric field at the oxide interface increases, causing additional surface scattering. The increased carrier scattering leads to a reduced mobility and a deviation from the ideal current\u2013voltage relation.\n- As the channel length decreases, the lateral electric field increases so that carriers flowing through the channel may reach their saturation velocity. In this case, the drain current becomes a linear function of gate-to-source voltage.\n- The tendency in MOSFET design is to make devices smaller. The principle of constant-field scaling has been discussed.\n- Modification in threshold voltage as device dimensions shrink has been discussed. Because of charge-sharing effects in the substrate, the threshold voltage decreases as channel length decreases and increases as channel width decreases.\n- Several voltage breakdown mechanisms have been discussed. These include oxide breakdown, avalanche breakdown, near avalanche or snapback breakdown, and near punch-through effects. These mechanisms are all enhanced as device dimensions shrink.\n  The lightly doped drain transistor tends to minimize the drain breakdown effects.\n- Ion implantation can be used essentially a final process step to change and adjust the substrate doping in the channel region to provide the desired threshold voltage. This process is referred to as threshold voltage adjustment by ion implantation and is used extensively in device fabrication.\n- The effect of ionization radiation and hot-electron effects on MOSFET behavior have been briefly discussed."}, {"id": 470, "content": "**GLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS**\n\n**channel length modulation** The change in effective channel length with drain-to-source voltage when the MOSFET is biased in saturation.\n\n**drain-induced barrier lowering** The near punch-through condition in which the potential barrier between the source and channel region in an off transistor is lowered due to a large applied drain voltage.\n\n**hot electrons** Electrons with energies far greater than the thermal-equilibrium value caused by acceleration in high electric fields.\n\n**lightly doped drain (LDD)** A MOSFET with a lightly doped drain region adjacent to the channel to reduce voltage breakdown effects.\n\n**narrow-channel effects** The shift in threshold voltage as the channel width narrows.\n\n**near punch-through** The reduction in the potential barrier between source and substrate by the drain-to-substrate voltage, resulting in a rapid increase in drain current.\n\n**short-channel effects** The shift in threshold voltage as the channel length becomes smaller.\n\n**snapback** The negative resistance effect during breakdown in a MOSFET caused by the variable current gain in a parasitic bipolar transistor.\n\n**subthreshold conduction** The process of current conduction in a MOSFET when the transistor is biased below the threshold inversion point.\n\n**surface scattering** The process of electric field attraction and coulomb repulsion of carriers at the oxide\u2013semiconductor interface as the carriers drift between source and drain.\n\n**threshold adjustment** The process of altering the threshold voltage by changing the semiconductor doping concentration through ion implantation."}, {"id": 472, "content": "## CHAPTER 12\n\n## The Bipolar Transistor\n\nThe transistor is a multijunction semiconductor device that, in conjunction with other circuit elements, is capable of current gain, voltage gain, and signal power gain.

The three terminal connections are called the emitter, base, and collector. The width of the base region is small compared to the minority carrier diffusion length. The (+ +) and (+) notation indicates the relative magnitudes of the impurity doping concentrations normally used in the bipolar transistor, with (+ +) meaning very heavily doped and (+) meaning moderately doped. The emitter region has the largest doping concentration; the collector region has the smallest. The reasons for using these relative impurity concentrations, and for the narrow base width, will become clear as we develop the theory of the bipolar transistor. The concepts developed for the pn junction apply directly to the bipolar transistor.\n\nThe block diagrams of <|begin_image|>Figure 12.1<|end_image|> show the basic structure of the transistor, but in very simplified sketches. <|begin_image|>Figure 12.2a<|end_image|> shows a cross section of a classic npn bipolar transistor fabricated in an integrated circuit configuration, and <|begin_image|>Figure 12.2b<|end_image|> shows the cross section of an npn bipolar transistor fabricated by a more modern technology. One can immediately observe that the actual structure of the bipolar transistor is not nearly as simple as the block diagrams of <|begin_image|>Figure 12.1<|end_image|> might suggest. A reason for the complexity is that terminal connections are made at the surface; in order to minimize semiconductor resistances, heavily doped n+ buried layers must be included. Another reason for complexity arises out of the desire to fabricate more than one bipolar transistor on a single piece of semiconductor material. Individual transistors must be isolated from each other since all collectors, for example, will not be at the same potential. This isolation is accomplished by adding p+ regions so that devices are separated by reverse-biased pn junctions as shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 12.2a<|end_image|>, or they are isolated by large oxide regions as shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 12.2b<|end_image|>.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 12.2<|end_image|> | Cross section of (a) a conventional integrated circuit npn bipolar transistor and (b) an oxide-isolated npn bipolar transistor.\n*(From Muller and Kamins [4].)*\n\nAn important point to note from the devices shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 12.2<|end_image|> is that the bipolar transistor is not a symmetrical device. Although the transistor may contain two n regions or two p regions, the impurity doping concentrations in the emitter and collector are different and the geometry of these regions can be vastly different.

This configuration is called the forward-active operating mode: The B-E junction is forward biased so electrons from the emitter are injected across the B-E junction into the base. These injected electrons create an excess concentration of minority carriers in the base. The B-C junction is reverse biased, so the minority carrier electron concentration at the edge of the B-C junction is ideally zero. We expect the electron concentration in the base to be like that shown in\n\n![Figure 12.4](a) Biasing of an npn bipolar transistor in the forward-active mode.

The large gradient in the electron concentration means that electrons injected from the emitter will diffuse across the base region into the B-C space charge region, where the electric field will sweep the electrons into the collector. We want as many electrons as possible to reach the collector without recombining with any majority carrier holes in the base. For this reason, the width of the base needs to be small compared with the minority carrier diffusion length. If the base width is small, then the minority carrier electron concentration is a function of both the B-E and B-C junction voltages. The two junctions are close enough to be called interacting pn junctions.\n\nFigure 12.5 shows a cross section of an npn transistor with the injection of electrons from the n-type emitter (hence the name emitter) and the collection of the electrons in the collector (hence the name collector)."}, {"id": 476, "content": "12.1.2 Simplified Transistor Current Relation\u2014Qualitative Discussion\n\nWe can gain a basic understanding of the operation of the transistor and the relations between the various currents and voltages by considering a simplified analysis. After this discussion, we delve into a more detailed analysis of the physics of the bipolar transistor.\n\nThe minority carrier concentrations are again shown in Figure 12.6 for an npn bipolar transistor biased in the forward-active mode. Ideally, the minority carrier electron concentration in the base is a linear function of distance, which implies no recombination. The electrons diffuse across the base and are swept into the collector by the electric field in the B-C space charge region.\n\n#### Collector Current\n\nAssuming the ideal linear electron distribution in the base, the collector current can be written as a diffusion current given by\n\n$$i_C = eD_cA_{BE} \\frac{dn(x)}{dx} = eD_cA_{BE} \\left[ \\frac{n_{be}(0) - 0}{0 - x_B} \\right] = -\\frac{eD_cA_{BE}}{x_B} \\cdot n_{be0} \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_t} \\right) \\tag{12.1}$$\n\nwhere $A_{BE}$ is the cross-sectional area of the B-E junction, $n_{be0}$ is the thermal-equilibrium electron concentration in the base, and $V_t$ is the thermal voltage.

Considering magnitudes only, Equation (12.1) can be written as\n\n$$i_c = I_S \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T} \\right) \\tag{12.2}$$\n\nThe collector current is controlled by the base\u2013emitter voltage; that is, the current at one terminal of the device is controlled by the voltage applied to the other two terminals of the device. As we have mentioned, this is the basic transistor action.\n\n### Emitter Current\n\nOne component of emitter current, $i_{E1}$, shown in Figure 12.6 is due to the flow of electrons injected from the emitter into the base. This current, then, is equal to the collector current given by Equation (12.1).\n\nSince the base\u2013emitter junction is forward biased, majority carrier holes in the base are injected across the B\u2013E junction into the emitter. These injected holes produce a pn junction current $i_{E2}$ as indicated in Figure 12.6. This current is only a B\u2013E junction current so this component of emitter current is not part of the collector current. Since $i_{E2}$ is a forward-biased pn junction current, we can write (considering magnitude only)\n\n$$i_{E2} = I_S \\exp \\left( \\frac{V_{BE}}{V_T} \\right) \\tag{12.3}$$![Graph](image_url)\n\n**Figure 12.7** Ideal bipolar transistor common-base current\u2013voltage characteristics.\n\nwhere $I_{s2}$ involves the minority carrier hole parameters in the emitter.

By considering Equation (12.4), we see that $i_c < i_e$ or $\\alpha < 1$. Since $i_{e2}$ is not part of the basic transistor action, we would like this component of current to be as small as possible. We would then like the common-base current gain to be as close to unity as possible.\n\nReferring to Figure 12.4a and Equation (12.4), note that the emitter current is an exponential function of the base\u2013emitter voltage and the collector current is $i_c = \\alpha i_e$. To a first approximation, the collector current is independent of the base\u2013collector voltage as long as the B\u2013C junction is reverse biased. We can sketch the common-base transistor characteristics as shown in Figure 12.7.

This component of base current is proportional to $\\exp (v_{be}/V_t)$.\n\nThere is also a second component of base current. We have considered the ideal case in which there is no recombination of minority carrier electrons with majority carrier holes in the base. However, in reality, there will be some recombination. Since majority carrier holes in the base are disappearing, they must be resupplied by a flow of positive charge into the base terminal. This flow of charge is indicated as a current $i_{bb}$ in Figure 12.6. The number of holes per unit time recombining in the base is directly related to the number of minority carrier electrons in the base[see Equation (6.13)]. Therefore, the current $i_{bb}$ is also proportional to $\\exp(\\nu_{bb}/V_t)$. The total base current is the sum of $i_{ba}$ and $i_{bb}$ and is proportional to $\\exp(\\nu_{bb}/V_t)$.\n\nThe ratio of collector current to base current is a constant since both currents are directly proportional to $\\exp(\\nu_{BE}/V_t)$.

In this configuration, the transistor may be biased in one of three modes of operation. If the B-E voltage is zero or reverse biased (\\( \\nu_{BE} \\approx 0 \\)), then majority carrier electrons from the emitter will not be injected into the base. The B-C junction is also reverse biased; thus, the emitter and collector currents will be zero for this case. This condition is referred to as cutoff\u2014all currents in the transistor are zero.\n\nWhen the B-E junction becomes forward biased, an emitter current will be generated as we have discussed, and the injection of electrons into the base results in a collector current.

Again, this condition is the forward-active region of operation.\n\nAs the forward-biased B-E voltage increases, the collector current and hence $V_R$ will also increase. The increase in $V_R$ means that the reverse-biased C-B voltage decreases, or $|V_{CB}|$ decreases. At some point, the collector current may become large\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 12.9](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 12.9 | Bipolar transistor common-emitter current\u2013voltage characteristics with load line superimposed.**\n\nenough that the combination of $V_B$ and $V_{CC}$ produces 0 V across the B\u2013C junction. A slight increase in $I_C$ beyond this point will cause a slight increase in $V_B$ and the B\u2013C junction will become forward biased ($V_{CB} < 0$). This condition is called _saturation_.[^1] In the saturation mode of operation, both B\u2013E and B\u2013C junctions are forward biased and the collector current is no longer controlled by the B\u2013E voltage.\n\nFigure 12.9 shows the transistor current characteristics, $I_C$ versus $V_{CE}$, for constant base currents when the transistor is connected in the common-emitter configuration (Figure 12.8). When the collector\u2013emitter voltage is large enough so that the base\u2013collector junction is reverse biased, the collector current is a constant in this first-order theory. For small values of C\u2013E voltage, the base\u2013collector junction becomes forward biased and the collector current decreases to zero for a constant base current.\n\nWriting a Kirchhoff\u2019s voltage equation around the C\u2013E loop, we find\n\n\\[ V_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_C R_C \\]\n\n(12.8)\n\nEquation (12.8) shows a linear relation between collector current and collector\u2013emitter voltage.

The dc voltage sources, V<sub>BB</sub> and V<sub>CC</sub>, are used to bias the transistor in the forward-active mode. The voltage source v<sub>i</sub> represents a time-varying input voltage (such as a signal from a satellite) that needs to be amplified.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 12.12](image1.png)<|end_image|>\n\nFigure 12.12 shows the various voltages and currents that are generated in the circuit assuming that v<sub>i</sub> is a sinusoidal voltage.

Since i<sub>B</sub> = \u03b2i<sub>B</sub>, then a relatively large sinusoidal collector current is superimposed on a dc value of collector current.

We expect the minority carrier distributions to look like those shown in Figure 12.14. As there are two n regions, we have minority carrier holes in both emitter and collector. To distinguish between these two minority carrier hole distributions, we use the notation shown in the figure. Keep in mind that we are dealing only with minority carriers. The parameters p_E0, p_B0, and p_C0 denote the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector, respectively. The functions p_E(x'), n_B(x), and p_C(x') denote the steady-state minority carrier concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector, respectively. We assume that the neutral collector length x_C is long compared to the minority carrier diffusion length L_C in the collector, but we take into account a finite emitter length x_E. If we assume that the surface recombination velocity at x' = x_E is infinite, then the excess minority carrier concentration at x' = x_E is zero, or p_E(x' = x_E) = p_B0.

In this case, the B-E is reverse biased and the B-C is forward biased. Electrons from the collector are now injected into the base. The gradient in the minority carrier electron concentration in the base is in the opposite direction compared with the forward-active mode, so the emitter and collector currents will change direction.

This base width, however, is a function of the B\u2013C voltage, since the width of the space charge region extending into the base region varies with B\u2013C voltage. As the B\u2013C reverse-biased voltage increases, the B\u2013C space charge region width increases, which reduces x_b. A change in the neutral base width will change the collector current as can be observed in Figure 12.21. A reduction in base width will cause the gradient in the minority carrier concentration to increase, which in turn causes an increase in the diffusion current. This effect is known as base width modulation; it is also called the Early effect.\n\nThe Early effect can be seen in the current\u2013voltage characteristics shown in Figure 12.22. In most cases, a constant base current is equivalent to a constant B\u2013E voltage. Ideally the collector current is independent of the B\u2013C voltage so that the slope of the curves would be zero; thus, the output conductance of the transistor would be zero. However, the base width modulation, or Early effect, produces a nonzero slope and gives rise to a finite output conductance.

An increase in the hole injection causes an increase in \\(J_{he}\\) current and an increase in \\(n_{pE}\\) reduces the emitter injection efficiency. The common-emitter current gain decreases, then, with high injection. Figure 12.24 shows a typical common-emitter current gain versus collector current curve. The low gain at low currents is due to the small recombination factor and the drop-off at the high current is due to the high-injection effect.\n\nWe now consider the second high-injection effect.

We have implied from our previous discussion that the emitter injection efficiency factor will continue to increase and approach unity as the ratio of emitter doping to base doping continues to increase. As silicon becomes heavily doped, the discrete donor energy level in an n-type emitter splits into a band of energies. The distance between donor atoms decreases as the concentration of impurity donor atoms increases, and the splitting of the donor level is caused by the interaction of donor atoms with each other. As the doping continues to increase, the donor band widens, becomes skewed, and moves up toward the conduction band, eventually merging with it. At this point, the effective bandgap energy has decreased. Figure 12.26 shows a plot of the change in the bandgap energy with impurity doping concentration.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Graph](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 12.26** Bandgap narrowing factor versus donor impurity concentration in silicon. *(From Sze [19].)*\n\nA reduction in the bandgap energy increases the intrinsic carrier concentration.

Figure 12.27 is a cross section of an npn transistor showing the lateral distribution of base current. The base region is typically less than a micrometer thick, so there can be a sizable base resistance. The nonzero base resistance results in a lateral potential difference under the emitter region. For the npn transistor, the potential decreases from the edge of the emitter toward the center. The emitter is highly doped, so as a first approximation the emitter can be considered an equipotential region.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 12.27](image1.png)<|end_image|>\n**Figure 12.27** | Cross section of an npn bipolar transistor showing the base current distribution and the lateral potential drop in the base region.\n\nThe number of electrons from the emitter injected into the base is exponentially dependent on the B-E voltage. With the lateral voltage drop in the base between the edge and center of the emitter, more electrons will be injected near the emitter edges than in the center, causing the emitter current to be crowded toward the edges. This current crowding effect is schematically shown in Figure 12.28. The larger current density near the emitter edge may cause localized heating effects as well as localized high-injection effects. The nonuniform emitter current also results in a nonuniform lateral base current under the emitter. A two-dimensional analysis would be required to calculate the actual potential drop versus distance because of the nonuniform base current. Another approach is to slice the transistor into a number of smaller parallel transistors and to lump the resistance of each base section into an equivalent external resistance.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 12.28](image2.png)<|end_image|>\n**Figure 12.28** | Cross section of an npn bipolar transistor showing the emitter current crowding effect.\n\nPower transistors, designed to handle large currents, require large emitter areas to maintain reasonable current densities.

The induced electric field in the base, because of the nonuniform doping, produces a force on the electrons in the direction toward the collector. The induced electric field, then, aids the flow of minority carriers across the base region. This electric field is called an **accelerating field**.\n\nThe accelerating field will produce a drift component of current that is in addition to the existing diffusion current. Since the minority carrier electron concentration varies across the base, the drift current density will not be constant. The total current across the base, however, is nearly constant. The induced electric field in the base due to nonuniform base doping will alter the minority carrier distribution through the base so that the sum of drift current and diffusion current will be a constant.

The first is called punch-through. As the reverse-biased B\u2013C voltage increases, the B\u2013C space charge region widens and extends farther into the neutral base. It is possible for the B\u2013C depletion region to penetrate completely through the base and reach the B\u2013E space charge region; the effect called **punch-through**. Figure 12.32a shows the energy-band diagram of an npn bipolar transistor in thermal equilibrium, and Figure 12.32b shows the energy-band diagram for two values of reverse-biased B\u2013C junction voltage. When a small C\u2013B voltage, V<sub>R1</sub>, is applied, the B\u2013E potential barrier is not affected; thus, the transistor current is still essentially zero. When a large reverse-biased voltage, V<sub>R2</sub>, is applied, the depletion region extends through the base region and the B\u2013E potential barrier is lowered because of the C\u2013B voltage. The lowering of the potential barrier at the B\u2013E junction produces a large increase in current with a very small increase in C\u2013B voltage. This effect is the punch-through breakdown phenomenon.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 12.32](image1.png)<|end_image|>\n**Figure 12.32** | Energy-band diagram of an npn bipolar transistor (a) in thermal equilibrium, and (b) with a reverse-biased B\u2013C voltage before punch-through, \\( V_{R1} \\), and after punch-through, \\( V_{R2} \\).\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 12.33](image2.png)<|end_image|>\n**Figure 12.33** | Geometry of a bipolar transistor to calculate the punch-through voltage.\n\nFigure 12.33 shows the geometry for calculating the punch-through voltage.

This bias\n\n---\n\n2The doping concentrations in the base and collector of the transistor are small enough that Zener breakdown is not a factor to be considered.condition also makes the B\u2013C junction reverse biased. The current in the transistor for this bias configuration is denoted as I_CEO.\n\nThe current I_CEO shown in Figure 12.34b is the normal reverse-biased B\u2013C junction current. Part of this current is due to the flow of minority carrier holes from the collector across the B\u2013C space charge region into the base. The flow of holes into the base makes the base positive with respect to the emitter, and the B\u2013E junction becomes forward biased. The forward-biased B\u2013E junction produces the current I_CEO due primarily to the injection of electrons from the emitter into the base. The injected electrons diffuse across the base toward the B\u2013C junction. These electrons are subject to all of the recombination processes in the bipolar transistor. When the electrons reach the B\u2013C junction, this current component is \u03b1I_CEO where \u03b1 is the common-base current gain.

However, switching is considered to be a large-signal change, whereas the frequency effects assumed only small changes in the magnitude of the signal."}, {"id": 539, "content": "12.7.1 Switching Characteristics\n\nConsider an npn transistor in the circuit shown in Figure 12.43a switching from cutoff to saturation, and then switching back from saturation to cutoff. We describe the physical processes taking place in the transistor during the switching cycle.\n\nConsider, initially, the case of switching from cutoff to saturation. Assume that in cutoff $V_{BE} = V_{BB} < 0$, thus the B\u2013E junction is reverse biased. At $t = 0$, assume that $V_{BB}$ switches to a value of $V_{BB0}$ as shown in Figure 12.43b. We assume that $V_{BB0}$ is sufficiently positive to eventually drive the transistor into saturation. For $0 \\leq t \\leq t_1$, the base current supplies charge to bring the B\u2013E junction from reverse bias to a slight forward bias. The space charge width of the B\u2013E junction is narrowing, and ionized donors and acceptors are being neutralized. A small amount of charge is also injected into the base during this time. The collector current increases from zero to 10 percent of its final value during this time period, referred to as the delay time.\n\nDuring the next time period, t1 \u2264 t \u2264 t2, the base current is supplying charge, which increases the B-E junction voltage from near cutoff to near saturation. During this time, additional carriers are being injected into the base so that the gradient of the minority carrier electron concentration in the base increases, causing the collector current to increase. We refer to this time period as the rise time, during which the collector current increases from 10 to 90 percent of the final value. For t > t2, the base drive continues to supply base current, driving the transistor into saturation and establishing the final minority carrier distribution in the device.\n\nThe switching of the transistor from saturation to cutoff involves removing all of the excess minority carriers stored in the emitter, base, and collector regions. Figure 12.44 shows the charge storage in the base and collector when the transistor is in saturation. The charge Qv is the excess charge stored in a forward-active transistor, and Qbx and Qc are the extra charges stored when the transistor is biased in saturation. At t = t3, the base voltage Vbb switches to a negative value of (\u2212Vbb). The base current in the transistor reverses direction as was the case in switching a pn junction diode from forward to reverse bias. The reverse base current pulls the excess stored carriers from the emitter and base regions. Initially, the collector current does not change significantly, since the gradient of the minority carrier concentration in the base does not change instantaneously. Recall that when the transistor is biased in saturation, both the B\u2013E and B\u2013C junctions are forward biased. The charge \\(Q_{bb}\\) in the base must be removed to reduce the forward-biased B\u2013C voltage to 0 V before the collector current can change. This time delay is called the storage time and is denoted by \\(t_s\\). The storage time is the time between the point at which \\(V_{bb}\\) switches to the time when the collector current is reduced to 90 percent of its maximum saturation value. The storage time is usually the most important parameter in the switching speed of the bipolar transistor.\n\nThe final switching delay time is the fall time \\(t_f\\) during which the collector current decreases from the 90 percent to the 10 percent value. During this time, the B\u2013C junction is reverse biased but excess carriers in the base are still being removed, and the B\u2013E junction voltage is decreasing.\n\nThe switching-time response of the transistor can be determined by using the Ebers\u2013Moll model. The frequency-dependent gain parameters must be used, and normally the Laplace transform technique is used to obtain the time response. The details of this analysis are quite tedious and are presented here."}, {"id": 540, "content": "12.7.2 The Schottky-Clamped Transistor\n\nOne method frequently employed to reduce the storage time and increase the switching speed is the use of a Schottky-clamped transistor. This is a normal npn bipolar device with a Schottky diode connected between base and collector, as shown in Figure 12.45a. The circuit symbol for the Schottky-clamped transistor is shown in Figure 12.45b. When the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, the B\u2013C junction is reverse biased; hence, the Schottky diode is reverse biased and effectively out of the circuit. The characteristics of the Schottky-clamped transistor\u2014or simply the Schottky transistor\u2014are those of the normal npn bipolar device.\n\nWhen the transistor is driven into saturation, the B\u2013C junction becomes forward biased; hence, the Schottky diode also becomes forward biased. We may recall from our discussion in Chapter 9 that the effective turn-on voltage of the Schottky diode is approximately half that of the pn junction. The difference in turn-on voltage means that most of the excess base current is shunted through the Schottky diode and awayfrom the base so that the amount of excess stored charge in the base and collector is drastically reduced. The excess minority carrier concentration in the base and collector at the B-C junction is an exponential function of V<sub>BC</sub>. If V<sub>BC</sub> is reduced from 0.5 to 0.3 V<sub>,</sub> for example, the excess minority carrier concentration is reduced by over three orders of magnitude. The reduced excess stored charge in the base of the Schottky transistor greatly reduces the storage time\u2014storage times on the order of 1 ns or less are common in Schottky transistors."}, {"id": 541, "content": "12.8 | OTHER BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR STRUCTURES\n\nThis section is intended to briefly introduce three specialized bipolar transistor structures.

The emitter width, in general, is thin, which increases speed and reduces parasitic resistance. However, a thin emitter increases the gradient in the minority carrier concentration, as indicated in Figure 12.19. The increase in the gradient increases the B-E junction current, which in turn decreases the emitter injection efficiency and decreases the common-emitter current gain. This effect is also shown in the summary of Table 12.3.\n\nFigure 12.46 shows the idealized cross section of an npn bipolar transistor with a polysilicon emitter. As shown in the figure, there is a very thin n<sup>+</sup> single-crystal silicon region between the p-type base and the n-type polysilicon. As a first approximation to the analysis, we may treat the polysilicon portion of the emitter as low-mobility silicon, which means that the corresponding diffusion coefficient is small.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Image](image_url)\n\n**Figure 12.46** Simplified cross section of an npn polysilicon emitter BJT.\n\nIf the neutral widths of both the polysilicon and single-crystal portions of the emitter are much smaller than the respective diffusion lengths, then the minority carrier distribution functions will be linear in each region. Both the minority carrier concentration and diffusion current must be continuous across the polysilicon/silicon interface. We can therefore write\n\n$$eD_{E(\\text{poly})} \\frac{d(\\delta p_{E(\\text{poly})})}{dx} = eD_{E(\\text{sin})} \\frac{d(\\delta p_{E(\\text{sin})})}{dx}$$\n\nor\n\n$$\\frac{d(\\delta p_{E(\\text{sin})})}{dx} = \\frac{D_{E(\\text{poly})}}{D_{E(\\text{sin})}} \\frac{d(\\delta p_{E(\\text{poly})})}{dx}$$\n\nSince $D_{E(\\text{poly})} < D_{E(\\text{sin})}$, then the gradient of the minority carrier concentration at the emitter edge of the B-E depletion region in the n+ region is reduced as Figure 12.47 shows. This implies that the current back-injected from the base into the emitter is reduced so that the common-emitter current gain is increased.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Image](image_url)\n\n**Figure 12.47** | Excess minority carrier hole concentrations in n+ polysilicon and n+ silicon emitter."}, {"id": 543, "content": "## 12.8.2 Silicon\u2013Germanium Base Transistor\n\nThe bandgap energy of germanium (Ge) (~0.67 eV) is significantly smaller than the bandgap energy of silicon (Si) (~1.12 eV). By incorporating Ge into Si, the bandgap energy will decrease compared to pure Si. If Ge is incorporated into the base region of a Si bipolar transistor, the decrease in bandgap energy will influence the device characteristics. The desired Ge concentration profile is to have the largest amount of Ge near the base\u2013collector junction and the least amount of Ge near the base\u2013emitter junction. <|begin_image|>Figure 12.48a<|end_image|> shows an ideal uniform boron doping concentration in the p-type base and a linear Ge concentration profile.\n\nThe energy bands of a SiGe-base npn transistor compared to a Si-base npn transistor, assuming the boron and Ge concentrations given in <|begin_image|>Figure 12.48a<|end_image|>, are shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 12.48b<|end_image|>. The emitter\u2013base junctions of the two transistors are essentially identical, since the Ge concentration is very small in this region. However, the bandgap energy of the SiGe-base transistor near the base\u2013collector junction is smaller than that of the Si-base transistor. The base current is determined by the base\u2013emitter junction parameters and hence will be essentially the same in the two transistors. This change in bandgap energy will influence the collector current.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 12.49<|end_image|> Thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron concentration through the base of the Si- and SiGe-base transistors.\n\n### Collector Current and Current Gain Effects\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 12.49<|end_image|> shows the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron concentration through the base region of the SiGe and Si transistors. This concentration is given by\n\n$$\nn_{b0} = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_B}\n$$\n\n(12.107)\n\nwhere \\(N_B\\) is assumed to be constant. The intrinsic concentration, however, is a function of the bandgap energy.

As a first approximation, we can see this from the previous analysis. The collector current is found from Equation (12.36a), in which the derivative is evaluated at the base\u2013collector junction. This means that the value of \\(n_{b0}\\) in the collector current expression in Equation (12.37) is the value at the base\u2013collector junction. Since this value is larger for the SiGe-base transistor (<|begin_image|>Figure 12.49<|end_image|>), the collector current will be larger compared to the Si-base transistor. Since the base currents are the same in the two transistors, the increase in collector current then implies that the current gain in the SiGe-base transistor is larger. If the bandgap narrowing is 100 meV, then the increase in the collector current and current gain will be approximately a factor of 4.\n\n### Early Voltage Effects\n\nThe Early voltage in a SiGe-base transistor is larger than that of the Si-base transistor. The explanation for this effect is less obvious than the explanation for the increase in collector current and current gain. For a bandgap narrowing of 100 meV, the Early voltage is increased by approximately a factor of 12. Incorporating Ge into the base region can increase the Early voltage by a large factor.\n\n### Base Transit Time and Emitter\u2013Base Charging Time Effects\n\nThe decrease in bandgap energy from the base\u2013emitter junction to the base\u2013collector junction induces an electric field in the base that helps accelerate electrons across the p-type base region. For a bandgap narrowing of 100 meV, the induced electric field can be on the order of 10^7 to 10^8 V/cm. This electric field reduces the base transit time by approximately a factor of 2.5.\n\nThe emitter\u2013base junction charging time constant, given by Equation (12.87), is directly proportional to the emitter diffusion resistance r_e. This parameter is inversely proportional to the emitter current, as seen in Equation (12.88). For a given base current, the emitter current in the SiGe-base transistor is larger, since the current gain is larger. The emitter\u2013base junction charging time is then smaller in a SiGe-base transistor than that in a Si-base transistor.\n\nThe reduction in both the base transit time and the emitter\u2013base charging time increases the cutoff frequency of the SiGe-base transistor. The cutoff frequency of these devices can be substantially higher than that of the Si-base device."}, {"id": 544, "content": "## 12.8.3 Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors\n\nAs mentioned previously, one of the basic limitations of the current gain in the bipolar transistor is the emitter injection efficiency. The emitter injection efficiency \u03b3 can be increased by reducing the value of the thermal-equilibrium minority carrier concentration p_bo in the emitter. However, as the emitter doping increases, the bandgap narrowing effect offsets any improvement in the emitter injection efficiency. One possible solution is to use a wide-bandgap material for the emitter, which will minimize the injection of carriers from the base back into the emitter.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 12.50a<|end_image|> shows a discrete aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)/gallium arsenide (GaAs) heterojunction bipolar transistor, and <|begin_image|>Figure 12.50b<|end_image|> shows the energy-band diagram of the n-AlGaAs emitter to p-GaAs base junction. The large potential barrier V_b limits the number of holes that will be injected back from the base into the emitter.\n\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration is a function of bandgap energy as\n\n$$n_i^2 \\propto \\exp \\left( \\frac{-E_g}{kT} \\right)$$\n\nFor a given emitter doping, the number of minority carrier holes injected into the emitter is reduced by a factor of\n\n$$\\exp \\left( \\frac{\\Delta E_g}{kT} \\right)$$\n\nin changing from a narrow- to wide-bandgap emitter. If \u0394E_g = 0.30 eV, for example, n_i would be reduced by approximately 10^3 at T = 300 K. The drastic reduction in n_i for the wide-bandgap emitter means that the requirements of a very high emitter doping can be relaxed and a high emitter injection efficiency can still be obtained. A lower emitter doping reduces the bandgap narrowing effect.\n\nThe heterojunction GaAs bipolar transistor has the potential of being a very high-frequency device. A lower emitter doping in the wide-bandgap emitter leads to a smaller junction capacitance, increasing the speed of the device. Also, for the GaAs npn device, the minority carriers in the base are electrons with a high mobility. The electron mobility in GaAs is approximately five times that in silicon; thus, the base transit time in the GaAs base is very short. Experimental AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction transistors with base widths on the order of 0.1 \u03bcm have shown cutoff frequencies on the order of 40 GHz.\n\nOne disadvantage of GaAs is the low minority carrier lifetime. The small lifetime is not a factor in the base of a narrow-base device, but results in a larger B-E recombination current, which decreases the recombination factor and reduces the current gain. A current gain of 150 has been reported."}, {"id": 545, "content": "## 12.9 | SUMMARY\n\n- There are two complementary bipolar transistors\u2014npn and pnp. Each transistor has three separately doped regions and two pn junctions. The center region (base) is very narrow, so the two pn junctions are said to be interacting junctions.\n- In the forward-active mode, the B\u2013E junction is forward biased and the B\u2013C junction is reverse biased. Majority carriers from the emitter are injected into the base where they become minority carriers. These minority carriers diffuse across the base into the B\u2013C space charge region where they are swept into the collector.\n- When a transistor is biased in the forward-active mode of operation, the current at one terminal of the transistor (collector current) is controlled by the voltage applied across the other two terminals of the transistor (base\u2013emitter voltage). This is the basic transistor action.\n- The minority carrier concentrations are determined in each region of the transistor. The principal currents in the device are determined by the diffusion of these minority carriers.\n- The common-base current gain, which leads to the common-emitter current gain, is a function of three factors\u2014emitter injection efficiency, base transport factor, and recombination factor. The emitter injection efficiency takes into account carriers from the base that are injected back into the emitter, the base transport factor takes into account recombination in the base region, and the recombination factor takes into account carriers that recombine within the forward-biased B\u2013E junction.\n- Several nonideal effects are considered:\n  1. Base width modulation, or Early effect\u2014the change in the neutral base width with a change in B\u2013C voltage, producing a change in collector current with a change in B\u2013C or C\u2013E voltage.\n  2. High-injection effects that cause the collector current to increase at a slower rate with base\u2013emitter voltage.\n  3. Emitter bandgap narrowing that produces a smaller emitter injection efficiency because of a very large emitter region doping concentration.\n  4. Current crowding effects that produce a larger current density at the emitter edge than in the center of the emitter.\n  5. A nonuniform base doping concentration that induces an electric field in the base region, which aids the flow of minority carriers across the base.\n  6. Two breakdown voltage mechanisms\u2014punch-through and avalanche.\n- Three equivalent circuits or mathematical models of the transistor are considered. The Ebers\u2013Moll model and equivalent circuit are applicable in any of the transistor operating modes. The Gummel\u2013Poon model is convenient to use when nonuniform doping exists in the transistor. The small-signal hybrid-pi model applies to transistors operating in the forward-active mode in linear amplifier circuits.\n- The cutoff frequency of a transistor, a figure of merit for the transistor, is the frequency at which the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain becomes equal to unity. The frequency response is a function of the emitter\u2013base junction capacitance charging time, the base transit time, the collector depletion region transit time, and the collector capacitance charging time.\n- The switching characteristics are closely related to the frequency limitations although switching involves large changes in currents and voltages.

A simplified cross section of a symmetrical device is shown in Figure 13.2. The n region between the two p regions is known as the channel and, in this n-channel device, majority carrier electrons flow between the source and drain terminals. The source is the terminal from which carriers enter the channel from the external circuit, the drain is the terminal where carriers leave, or are drained from, the device, and the gate is the control terminal. The two gate terminals shown in Figure 13.2 are tied together to form a single gate connection. Since majority carrier electrons are primarily involved in the conduction in this n-channel transistor, the JFET is a majority-carrier device.\n\nA complementary p-channel JFET can also be fabricated in which the p and n regions are reversed from those of the n-channel device. Holes will flow in the p-type channel between source and drain and the source terminal will now be the source of the holes. The current direction and voltage polarities in the p-channel JFET are the reverse of those in the n-channel device. The p-channel JFET is generally a lower frequency device than the n-channel JFET due to the lower hole mobility.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 13.1 | Idealization of the Lilienfeld transistor.](From Pierret [10].)<|end_image|>\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 13.2 | Cross section of a symmetrical n-channel pn junction FET.](From Pierret [10].)<|end_image|>\n\nFigure 13.3a shows an n-channel pn JFET with zero volts applied to the gate. If the source is at ground potential, and if a small positive drain voltage is applied, a drain current \\(I_D\\) is produced between the source and drain terminals. The n channel is essentially a resistance so the \\(I_D\\) versus \\(V_{DS}\\) characteristic, for small \\(V_{DS}\\) values, is approximately linear, as shown in the figure.\n\nWhen we apply a voltage to the gate of a pn JFET with respect to the source and drain, we alter the channel conductance. If a negative voltage is applied to the gate of the n-channel pn JFET shown in Figure 13.3, the gate-to-channel pn junction becomes reverse biased. The space charge region now widens so the channel region becomes narrower and the resistance of the n channel increases. The slope of the \\(I_D\\) versus \\(V_{DS}\\) curve, for small \\(V_{DS}\\), decreases. These effects are shown in Figure 13.3b. If a larger negative gate voltage is applied, the condition shown in Figure 13.3c can be achieved. The reverse-biased gate-to-channel space charge region has completely filled the channel region. This condition is known as pinchoff. The drain current at pinchoff is essentially zero, since the depletion region isolates the source and drain terminals. Figure 13.3c shows the \\(I_D\\) versus \\(V_{DS}\\) curve for this case, as well as the other two cases.\n\nThe current in the channel is controlled by the gate voltage. The control of the current in one part of the device by a voltage in another part of the device is the basic transistor action. This device is a normally on or depletion mode device, which means that a voltage must be applied to the gate terminal to turn the device off.\n\nNow consider the situation in which the gate voltage is held at zero volts, \\(V_{GS} = 0\\), and the drain voltage changes. Figure 13.4a is a replica of Figure 13.3a for zero gate voltage and a small drain voltage. As the drain voltage increases (positive), the gate-to-channel pn junction becomes reverse biased near the drain terminal so that the space charge region extends further into the channel. The channel is essentially a resistor, and the effective channel resistance increases as the space charge region widens; therefore, the slope of the \\(I_D\\) versus \\(V_{DS}\\) characteristic decreases as shown in Figure 13.4b. The effective channel resistance now varies along the channel length and, since the channel current must be constant, the voltage drop through the channel becomes dependent on position.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Image](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 13.3** Gate-to-channel space charge regions and I-V characteristics for small V_DS values and for (a) zero gate voltage, (b) small reverse-biased gate voltage, and (c) a gate voltage to achieve pinchoff.\n\nIf the drain voltage increases further, the condition shown in Figure 13.4c can result. The channel has been pinched off at the drain terminal. Any further increase in drain voltage will not cause an increase in drain current. The I-V characteristic for this condition is also shown in this figure. The drain voltage at pinchoff is referred to as V_DS(sat). For V_DS > V_DS(sat), the transistor is said to be in the saturation region and the drain current, for this ideal case, is independent of V_DS. At first glance, we might expect the drain current to go to zero when the channel becomes pinched off at the drain terminal, but we will show why this does not happen.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 13.4](image-url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 13.4** Gate-to-channel space charge regions and I-V characteristics for zero gate voltage and for (a) a small drain voltage, (b) a larger drain voltage, and (c) a drain voltage to achieve pinchoff at the drain terminal.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 13.5](image-url)<|end_image|>\n\nFigure 13.5 shows an expanded view of the pinchoff region in the channel.

The gate junction in the pn junction FET is replaced by a Schottky barrier rectifying contact. Although MESFETs can be fabricated in silicon, they are usually associated with gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor materials. A simplified cross section of a GaAs MESFET is shown in Figure 13.6. A thin epitaxial layer of GaAs is used for the active region; the substrate is a very high resistivity GaAs material referred to as a semi-insulating substrate. GaAs is intentionally doped with chromium, which behaves as a single acceptor close to the center of the energy bandgap, to make it semi-insulating with a resistivity as high as 10^9 \u03a9-cm. The advantages of these devices include higher electron mobility, hence smaller transit time and faster response; and decreased parasitic capacitance and a simplified fabrication process, resulting from the semi-insulating GaAs substrate.\n\nIn the MESFET shown in Figure 13.6, a reverse-biased gate-to-source voltage induces a space charge region under the metal gate that modulates the channel conductance as in the case of the pn JFET. The space charge region will eventually reach the substrate if the applied negative gate voltage is sufficiently large. This condition, again, is known as pinchoff. The device shown in this figure is also a depletion mode device, since a gate voltage must be applied to pinch off the channel.\n\nIf we treat the semi-insulating substrate as an intrinsic material, then the energy-band diagram of the substrate-channel-metal structure is as shown in Figure 13.7 for the case of zero bias applied to the gate. Because there is a potential barrier between the channel and substrate and between the channel and metal, the majority carrier electrons are confined to the channel region.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 13.7](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 13.7** Idealized energy-band diagram of the substrate-channel-metal in the n-channel MESFET.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 13.8](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 13.8** Channel space charge region of an enhancement mode MESFET for (a) \\( V_{GS} = 0 \\), (b) \\( V_{GS} = V_T \\), and (c) \\( V_{GS} > V_T \\).\n\nConsider, now, another type of MESFET in which the channel is pinched off even at V_GS = 0. Figure 13.8a shows this condition, in which the channel thickness is smaller than the zero-biased space charge width. To open a channel, the depletion region must be reduced: A forward-bias voltage must be applied to the gate-semiconductor junction. When a slightly forward-bias voltage is applied, the depletion region just extends through the channel\u2014a condition known as **threshold**, shown in Figure 13.8b. The threshold voltage is the gate-to-source voltage that must be applied to create the pinchoff condition. The threshold voltage for this n-channel MESFET is positive, in contrast to the negative voltage for the n-channel depletion mode device. If a larger forward bias is applied, the channel region opens as shown in Figure 13.8c. The applied forward-bias gate voltage is limited to a few tenths of a volt before there is significant gate current. This device is known as an n-channel enhancement mode MESFET. Enhancement mode p-channel MESFETs and enhancement mode pn junction FETs have also been fabricated. The advantage of enhancement mode MESFETs is that circuits can be designed in which the voltage polarity on the gate and drain is the same. However, the output voltage swing will be quite small with these devices."}, {"id": 555, "content": "# 13.2 | THE DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS\n\nTo describe the basic electrical characteristics of the JFET, we initially consider a uniformly doped depletion mode pn JFET and then later discuss the enhancement mode device.

These requirements imply a very small FET with a short channel length, large saturation current, and large transconductance. These requirements are generally achieved by increasing the channel doping under the gate. In all of the devices we have considered, the channel region is in a doped layer of bulk semiconductor with the majority carriers and doping impurities in the same region. The majority carriers experience ionized impurity scattering, which reduces carrier mobility and degrades device performance.\n\nThe degradation in mobility and peak velocity in GaAs due to increased doping can be minimized by separating the majority carriers from the ionized impurities. This separation can be achieved in a heterostructure that has an abrupt discontinuity in conduction and valence bands. We considered the basic heterojunction properties in Chapter 9. Figure 13.23 shows the conduction-band energy relative to the Fermi energy of an N-AlGaAs-intrinsic GaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium is achieved when electrons from the wide-bandgap AlGaAs flow into the GaAs and are confined to the potential well.

Electron sheet carrier densities on the order of 10^12 cm^-2 have been obtained. An improvement in the low-field mobility of the carriers moving parallel to the heterojunction is observed since the impurity-scattering effects are reduced. At 300 K, mobilities have been reported in the range of 8500\u20139000 cm^2/V\u00b7s, whereas GaAs MESFETs doped to N_D ~ 10^17 cm^-3 have low-field mobilities of less than 5000 cm^2/V\u00b7s. The electron mobility in the heterojunction now tends to be dominated by lattice or phonon scattering, so that as the temperature is reduced, the mobility increases rapidly.\n\nImpurity-scattering effects can be further reduced by increasing the separation of the electrons and ionized donor impurities. The electrons in the potential well of the abrupt heterojunction shown in Figure 13.23 are separated from the donor atoms, but are still close enough to be subjected to a coulomb attraction.

The N-AlGaAs is separated from the undoped GaAs by an undoped AlGaAs spacer. A Schottky contact to the N-AlGaAs forms the gate of the transistor. This structure is a \u201cnormal\u201d MODFET. An \u201cinverted\u201d structure is shown in Figure 13.27. In this case the Schottky contact is made to the undoped GaAs layer.

With zero bias, the conduction-band edge in the GaAs is below the Fermi level, implying a large density of the two-dimensional electron gas. With a negative voltage applied to the gate, the conduction-band edge in the GaAs is above the Fermi level, implying that the density of the two-dimensional electron gas is very small and the current in an FET would be essentially zero.\n\nThe Schottky barrier depletes the AlGaAs layer from the surface, and the heterojunction depletes the AlGaAs layer from the heterojunction interface. Ideally the device should be designed so that the two depletion regions just overlap to prevent electron conduction through the AlGaAs layer. For depletion mode devices, the depletion layer from the Schottky gate should extend only to the heterojunction depletion layer. For enhancement mode devices, the thickness of the doped AlGaAs layer is smaller and the Schottky gate built-in potential barrier will completely deplete the AlGaAs layer and the two-dimensional electron gas channel. A positive voltage applied to the gate of the enhancement mode device will turn on the device.\n\nThe density of the two-dimensional electron gas in a normal structure can be described using a charge control model.

This analysis is very similar to that for the pn JFET in Section 13.2.2.\n\nIf we assume a constant mobility, then for low V<sub>Ds</sub> values, we have\n\n$$I_D = \\frac{\u03b5_v \u03bc W}{2L(d + \u0394d)} [2(V_s - V_{th}) V_{Ds} - V_{Ds}^2]$$\n\nThe form of this equation is the same as that for the pn JFET or MESFET operating in the nonsaturation region. If V<sub>Ds</sub> increases so that the carriers reach the saturation velocity, then\n\n$$I_D(sat) = \\frac{\u03b5_v W}{(d + \u0394d)} (V_s - V_{th} - V_0) v_{sat}$$\n\nwhere v<sub>sat</sub> is the saturation velocity and V<sub>0</sub> = E<sub>s</sub>L, with E<sub>s</sub> being the electric field in the channel that produces the saturation velocity. Various velocity versus electric field models can be used to derive different I-V expressions. However, Equations (13.74) and (13.75) yield satisfactory results for most situations. Figure 13.30 shows a comparison between experimental and calculated I-V characteristics. As observed in the figure, the current in these heterojunction devices can be quite large. The transconductance of the MODFET is defined as it was for the pn JFET and MESFET. Typical measured values at T = 300 K are in the range of 250 mS/mm. Higher values have been reported. These transconductance values are significantly larger than for either the pn JFET or the MESFET.\nHEMTs may also be fabricated with multiple heterojunction layers. This device type is shown in Figure 13.31. A single heterojunction for an AlGaAs-GaAs interface has a maximum two-dimensional electron sheet density on the order of 1 x 10^12 cm^-2. This concentration can be increased by fabricating two or more AlGaAs-GaAs interfaces in the same epitaxial layer. The device current capacity is increased, and power performance is improved. The multichannel HEMT behaves as multiple single-channel HEMTs connected in parallel and modulated by the same gate but with slightly different threshold voltages. The maximum transconductance will not scale directly with the number of channels because of the change in threshold voltage with each channel. In addition, the effective channel length increases as the distance between the gate and channel increases.\n\nHEMTs can be used in high-speed logic circuits. They have been used in flip-flop circuits operating at clock frequencies of 5.5 GHz at T = 300 K; the clock frequency can be increased at lower temperatures. Small-signal, high-frequency amplifiers have also been investigated. HEMTs showing low noise and reasonable gains have been operated at 35 GHz. The maximum frequency increases as the channel length decreases. Cutoff frequencies on the order of 100 GHz have been measured with channel lengths of 0.25 \u03bcm.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 13.30](image1.png)<|end_image|> | Current-voltage characteristics of an enhancement mode HEMT, in which solid curves are numerical calculations and dots are measured points.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 13.31](image2.png)<|end_image|> | A multilayer HEMT.\n\n(From Sze [131])\n\nSource Gate Drain\n\nGaAs buffer\n\nSemi-insulating substrate\n\nIt seems clear that HEMTs are inherently superior to other FET technologies in terms of achieving higher speeds of operation, lower power dissipation, and lower noise. These advantages derive directly from the superior transport properties obtained by using undoped GaAs as the channel layer for the FET. One way to achieve an adequate carrier concentration in an undoped channel is to accumulate the carriers at a semiconductor heterojunction interface, as we have seen. The disadvantage of the HEMT is that the fabrication processes for the heterojunction are more complicated."}, {"id": 593, "content": "### 13.6 | SUMMARY\n\n- The physics, characteristics, and operation of the junction field-effect transistor are considered in this chapter.\n- The current in a JFET is controlled by an electric field applied perpendicular to the direction of current. The current is in the channel region between the source and drain contacts. In a pn JFET, the channel forms one side of a pn junction that is used to modulate the channel conductance.\n- Two primary parameters of the JFET are the internal pinchoff voltage V_pi and the pinchoff voltage V_p. The internal pinchoff voltage is defined as a positive quantity and is the total gate-to-channel potential that causes the junction space charge layer to completely fill the channel region. The pinchoff voltage is defined as the gate voltage that must be applied to achieve the pinchoff condition.\n- The ideal current\u2013voltage relationship is derived. The transconductance, or transistor gain, is the rate of change of drain current with respect to the corresponding change in gate-to-source voltage.\n- Three nonideal effects are considered: channel-length modulation, velocity saturation, and subthreshold current. Each of these effects changes the ideal current\u2013voltage relationship.\n- A small-signal equivalent circuit of the JFET is developed. The equivalent circuit includes capacitances that introduce frequency effects in the transistor. Two physical factors affect the frequency limitation: channel transit time and capacitance charging time. The capacitance charging time constant is normally the limiting factor in short channel devices.\n- The high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure utilizes a heterojunction. A two-dimensional electron gas is confined to a potential well at the heterojunction interface. However, the electrons are free to move parallel to the interface. These electrons are separated from the ionized donors so that ionized impurity scattering effects are minimized, resulting in a high mobility."}, {"id": 594, "content": "### GLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS\n\n**capacitance charging time** The time associated with charging or discharging the input gate capacitance with a change in the input gate signal.\n\n**channel conductance** The ratio of a differential change in drain current to the corresponding differential change in drain-to-source voltage in the limit as the drain-to-source voltage approaches zero.\n\n**channel conductance modulation** The process whereby the channel conductance changes with gate voltage; this is the basic field-effect transistor action.\n\n**channel length modulation** The change in effective channel length with drain-to-source voltage with the JFET biased in the saturation region.\n\n**conduction parameter** The multiplying factor k in the expression for drain current versus gate-to-source voltage for the enhancement mode MESFET.\n\n**cutoff frequency** A figure of merit for the transistor defined to be the frequency at which the ratio of the small-signal input gate current to small-signal drain current is equal to unity.\n\n**depletion mode JFET** A JFET in which a gate-to-source voltage must be applied to create pinchoff and turn the device off.\n\n**enhancement mode JFET** A JFET in which pinchoff exists at zero gate voltage and a gate-to-source voltage must be applied to induce a channel, turning the device on.\n\n**internal pinchoff voltage** The total potential drop across the gate junction at pinchoff.\n\n**output resistance** The ratio of a differential change in drain-to-source voltage to the corresponding differential change in drain current at a constant gate-to-source voltage.\n\n**pinchoff** The condition whereby the gate junction space charge region extends completely through the channel so that the channel is completely depleted of free carriers."}, {"id": 595, "content": "## CHECKPOINT\n\nAfter studying this chapter, the reader should have the ability to:\n\n- Describe the basic operation of the pn JFET and MESFET.\n- Discuss how current is contained in the channel region of a GaAs MESFET with a semi-insulating substrate.\n- Sketch the I-V characteristics of a depletion mode JFET.\n- Discuss how the internal pinchoff voltage is defined and how the pinchoff voltage is defined.\n- Define transconductance for a JFET.\n- Discuss the concept of an enhancement mode MESFET.\n- Discuss three nonideal effects in a JFET including channel-length modulation, velocity saturation effects, and subthreshold effects.\n- Sketch the small-signal equivalent circuit of a JFET.\n- Discuss the frequency limitation factors and define the cutoff frequency.\n- Sketch the cross section of a simple HEMT."}, {"id": 596, "content": "## Optical Devices\n\nIn previous chapters, we have considered the basic physics of transistors that are used to amplify or switch electrical signals.

For example, photons can interact with the semiconductor lattice whereby the photon energy is converted into heat. Photons can also interact with impurity atoms, either donors or acceptors, or they can interact with defects within the semiconductor. However, the basic photon interaction process of greatest interest is the interaction with valence electrons. When a photon collides with a valence electron, enough energy may be imparted to elevate the electron into the conduction band.

In this case, the light is transmitted through the material and the semiconductor appears to be transparent.\n\nIf $E = h\\nu > E_g$, the photon can interact with a valence electron and elevate the electron into the conduction band. The valence band contains many electrons and the conduction band contains many empty states, so the probability of this interaction is high when $h\\nu > E_g$.

A photon with energy greater than $E_g$ will contribute to the solar cell output power, but the fraction of photon energy that is greater than $E_g$ will eventually only be dissipated as heat. Figure 14.9 shows the solar spectral irradiance (power per unit area per unit wavelength) where air mass zero represents the solar spectrum outside the earth\u2019s atmosphere and air mass one is the solar spectrum at the earth\u2019s surface at noon. The maximum efficiency of a silicon pn junction solar cell is approximately 28 percent. Nonideal factors, such as series resistance and reflection from the semiconductor surface, will lower the conversion efficiency typically to the range of 10 to 15 percent.\n\nA large optical lens can be used to concentrate sunlight onto a solar cell so that the light intensity can be increased up to several hundred times. The short-circuit current increases linearly with light concentration while the open-circuit voltage increases only slightly with concentration. Figure 14.10 shows the ideal solar cell efficiency at 300 K for two values of solar concentration. We can see that the conversion efficiency increases only slightly with optical concentration. The primary advantage of using concentration techniques is to reduce the overall system cost since an optical lens is less expensive than an equivalent area of solar cells.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Graph of Solar Spectral Irradiance](image1.png)\n\n**Figure 14.9 | Solar spectral irradiance.**\n(From Sze [18].)\n\n<|begin_image|>![Graph of Ideal Solar Cell Efficiency](image2.png)\n\n**Figure 14.10 | Ideal solar cell efficiency at T = 300 K for C = 1 sun and for a C = 1000 sun concentrations as a function of bandgap energy.**\n(From Sze [18].)"}, {"id": 614, "content": "### 14.2.3 Nonuniform Absorption Effects\n\nWe have seen from the previous section that the photon absorption coefficient in a semiconductor is a very strong function of the incident photon energy or wavelength.

A system powered by solar cells requires, in general,\na very large area solar cell array to generate the required power. Amorphous silicon solar cells provide the possibility of fabricating large area and relatively inexpensive solar cell systems.\n\nWhen silicon is deposited by CVD techniques at temperatures below 600\u00b0C, an amorphous film is formed regardless of the type of substrate. In amorphous silicon, there is only very short range order, and no crystalline regions are observed. Hydrogen may be incorporated in the silicon to reduce the number of dangling bonds, creating a material called hydrogenated amorphous silicon.\n\nThe density of states versus energy for amorphous silicon is shown in Figure 14.14. Amorphous silicon contains large numbers of electronic energy states within the normal bandgap of single-crystal silicon. However, because of the short-range order, the effective mobility is quite small, typically in the range between 10^-6 and 10^-3 cm^2/V-s. The mobilities in the states above E_c and below E_v are between 1 and 10 cm^2/V-s. Consequently, conduction through the energy states between E_c and E_v is negligible because of the low mobility. Because of the difference in mobility values, E_c and E_v are referred to as the mobility edges and the energy between E_c and E_v is referred to as the mobility gap. The mobility gap can be modified by adding specific types of impurities.

For example, after the excess electron is generated, it drifts very quickly out of the photoconductor at the anode terminal. In order to maintain charge neutrality throughout the photoconductor, another electron immediately enters the photoconductor at the cathode and drifts toward the anode. This process will continue during a time period equal to the mean carrier lifetime. At the end of this period, on the average, the photoelectron will recombine with a hole.\n\nThe electron transit time, using the parameters from Example 14.4, is t\u2091 = 7.41 x 10\u207b\u2079 s. In a simplistic sense, the photoelectron will circulate around the photoconductor circuit 135 times during the 10\u207b\u2076 s time duration, which is the mean carrier lifetime. If we take into account the photon-generated hole, the total number of charges collected at the photoconductor contacts for every electron generated is 183.\n\nWhen the optical signal ends, the photocurrent will decay exponentially with a time constant equal to the minority carrier lifetime. From the photoconductor gain expression, we would like a large minority carrier lifetime, but the switching speed is enhanced by a small minority carrier lifetime. There is obviously a trade-off between gain and speed.

Some recombination processes may result in photon emission from direct bandgap materials, whereas other recombination processes in the same material may not.\n\nFigure 14.21a shows the basic interband transitions. Curve (i) corresponds to an intrinsic emission very close to the bandgap energy of the material. Curves (ii) and (iii) correspond to energetic electrons or holes. If either of these recombinations result in the emission of a photon, the energy of the emitted photon will be slightly larger than the bandgap energy. There will then be an emission spectrum and a bandwidth associated with the emission.\n\nThe possible recombination processes involving impurity or defect states are shown in Figure 14.21b. Curve (i) is the conduction band to acceptor transition, curve (ii) is the donor to valence-band transition, curve (iii) is the donor to acceptor transition, and curve (iv) is the recombination due to a deep trap. Curve (iv) is a nonradiative process corresponding to the Shockley\u2013Read\u2013Hall recombination process discussed in Chapter 6. The other recombination processes may or may not result in the emission of a photon.\n\nFigure 14.21c shows the Auger recombination process, which can become important in direct bandgap materials with high doping concentrations. The Auger recombination process is a nonradiative process. The Auger recombination, in one case, shown in curve (i), is a recombination between an electron and hole, accompanied by the transfer of energy to another free hole. Similarly, in the second case, the recombination between an electron and hole can result in the transfer of energy to a free electron as shown in curve (ii). The third particle involved in this process will eventually lose its energy to the lattice in the form of heat. The process involving two holes and an electron would occur predominantly in heavily doped p-type materials, and the process involving two electrons and a hole would occur primarily in a heavily doped n-type material.\n\nThe recombination processes shown in Figure 14.21a indicate that the emission of a photon is not necessarily at a single, discrete energy, but can occur over a range of energies. The spontaneous emission rate generally has the form\n\n$$I(\\nu) \\propto \\nu^2 (h\\nu - E_g)^{1/2} \\exp \\left[ \\frac{-(h\\nu - E_g)}{kT} \\right]$$\n\nwhere $E_g$ is the bandgap energy.

Significant improvement in device characteristics can be made if the emitted photons are confined to a region near the junction. This confinement can be achieved by using an optical dielectric waveguide. The basic device is a three-layered, double heterojunction structure known as a double heterojunction laser. A requirement for a dielectric waveguide is that the index of refraction of the center material be larger than that of the other two dielectrics.

Electrons are injected from the N-AlGaAs into the p-GaAs. Population inversion is easily obtained since the conduction band potential barrier prevents the electrons from diffusing into the P-AlGaAs region. Radiative recombination is then confined to the p-GaAs region. Since the index of refraction of GaAs is larger than that of AlGaAs, the light wave is also confined to the GaAs region.

When the diode current becomes large, a single dominant mode with a narrow bandwidth is produced.\n\nThe performance of the laser diode can be further improved if a very narrow recombination region is used with a somewhat wider optical waveguide.

The change in conductivity of the semiconductor due to the creation of excess electrons and holes by the incident photons is the basis of this device.\n- Photodiodes are diodes that have reverse-biased voltages applied. Excess carriers that are created by incident photons in the space-charge region are swept out by the electric field creating a photocurrent. The photocurrent is directly proportional to the incident photon intensity. PIN and avalanche photodiodes are variations of the basic photodiode.\n- The photocurrent generated in a phototransistor is multiplied by the transistor gain. However, the time response of the phototransistor may be slower than that of a photodiode because of the Miller effect and Miller capacitance.\n- The inverse mechanism of photon absorption in a pn junction is injection electroluminescence. The recombination of excess electrons and holes in a direct bandgap semiconductor can result in the emission of photons.\n- The light emitting diodes (LEDs) are the class of pn junction diodes whose photon output is a result of spontaneous recombinations of excess electrons and holes. A fairly wide bandwidth in the output signal, on the order of 30 nm, is a result of the spontaneous process.\n- The output of a laser diode is the result of stimulated emission.

Recall that the device is a pn junction in which both the n and p regions are degenerately doped. With the very high doping concentrations, the space charge region width is very narrow (W = 0.5 x 10^-6 cm = 50 A).\n\nThe forward-bias current\u2013voltage characteristics are again shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 15.1a<|end_image|>. For small forward-bias voltages (V < V_p), electrons in the conduction band on the n side are directly opposite empty states in the valence band of the p region (see Figure 8.29). Electrons tunnel through the potential barrier into the empty states producing a tunneling current. For forward-bias voltages in the range V_p < V < V_v, the number of electrons on the n side directly opposite empty states on the p side decreases so that the tunneling current decreases. For V > V_v, the normal diode diffusion currents dominate.\n\nA decrease in current with an increase in voltage produces a region of negative differential resistance in the range V_p < V < V_v. A negative differential resistance phenomenon is necessary for oscillators.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 15.1.1 (a)<|end_image|> shows an expanded plot of the I-V characteristics in the tunneling range. A point is shown on the curve where the minimum value of negative resistance occurs. (Note that R_min is a positive quantity.) The equivalent circuit of the tunnel diode for the case when the diode is biased at the -R_min point is shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 15.2<|end_image|>. The parameter C_j is the junction capacitance, and the parameters L_p and R_p are the parasitic or interconnect line inductance and resistance, respectively.\n\nThe small signal input impedance can be written as\n\nZ = \\left[R_p - \\frac{R_{\\text{min}}}{1 + \\omega^2 R_{\\text{min}}^2 C_j^2} + j\\omega \\left( L_p - \\frac{\\omega R_{\\text{min}}^2 C_j}{1 + \\omega^2 R_{\\text{min}}^2 C_j^2} \\right) \\right] \\tag{15.1}\n\nThe resistive part of the impedance goes to zero at a frequency of\n\nf_r = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi R_{\\text{min}} C_j} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\text{min}}}{R_p} - 1} \\tag{15.2}\n\nFor frequencies f > f_r, the resistive part of the impedance becomes positive so that the diode loses its negative differential resistance characteristic. The operating frequency must then occur at f_r < f_r. The frequency f_r is referred to as the maximum resistive cutoff frequency.\n\nThe tunneling process is a majority carrier effect so the diode does not exhibit time delays due to minority carrier diffusion, which means that the diode is capable of operating at microwave frequencies. However, due to the relatively small voltage range in which the diode exhibits the negative resistance characteristic, the tunnel diode is not used extensively."}, {"id": 667, "content": "**Another negative differential resistance device is the GUNN diode, or Transferred-Electron Device (TED).** The transferred-electron phenomenon is demonstrated in a few semiconductors in which conduction electrons in a high-mobility band are scattered to a low-mobility band by a high electric field. In Chapter 5, we discussed the drift velocity of electrons in GaAs versus electric field. Figure 15.3 again shows a plot of this characteristic. InP also shows this same characteristic.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Graph of Drift Velocity versus Electric Field for GaAs](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 15.3** | Electron drift velocity versus electric field for GaAs.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Energy-band structure of GaAs](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 15.4** | Energy-band structure of GaAs showing the lower valley and upper valley in the conduction band.\n\nFor small electric fields, essentially all of the electrons in the conduction band exist in the lower valley of the E versus k diagram, where the density of states electron effective mass is small. A small effective mass leads to a large mobility value.\n\nAs the electric field increases above a threshold or critical value, \\(E_{th}\\), the electrons gain more than the 0.3 eV energy separating the two valleys so that electrons can be scattered into the upper valley, where the density of states electron effective mass is much larger. The larger effective mass yields a smaller mobility. The intervalley transfer mechanism with a change in mobility results in a decreasing average drift velocity of electrons with electric field, or a negative differential electron mobility. The maximum negative differential electron mobility in GaAs is approximately -2400 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s.\n\nConsider a two-terminal n-type GaAs device with ohmic contacts at the ends that is biased in the negative mobility region (\\(E_{bias} > E_{th}\\)) as shown in Figure 15.5a. A small space charge region may develop in the material near the cathode as shown in Figure 15.5b. As a result, the electric field increases in this region as shown in Figure 15.5c. (Special device structures can be fabricated to ensure that the space charge fluctuations are generated near the cathode.)\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 15.5](image-url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 15.5** (a) A simplified two-terminal GaAs device. (b) Electron concentration versus distance showing a space charge formation. (c) Electric field versus distance.\n\nIn discussing excess carrier behavior in Chapter 6, we found the time behavior of a net charge density in a semiconductor to be given by\n\n$$\\delta Q(t) = \\delta Q(0)e^{-t/\\tau_d}$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_d$ is the dielectric relaxation time constant and is on the order of a picosecond. Normally, a small space charge region would be quickly neutralized. The dielectric relaxation time constant is given by $\\tau_d = \\epsilon / \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the semiconductor conductivity. If the GaAs is biased in the negative mobility region, then the conductivity is negative and the exponent in Equation (15.3) becomes positive, so the space charge region, now called a *domain*, can actually build up as it drifts toward the anode. As the domain grows (Figure 15.6a), the electric field in this region increases which means that the electric field in the remaining material decreases. The E field in the material outside of the domain can drop below the critical value, as indicated in Figure 15.6b, while the E field within the domain remains above the critical value. For this reason, only one domain will normally be established in the material at any given time.\n\nAs the domain reaches the anode, a current pulse is induced in the external circuit. After the domain reaches the anode, another domain may form near the cathode and the process repeats itself. Thus, a series of current pulses may be generated as shown in Figure 15.7. The time between current pulses is the time for the domain to drift through the device. The oscillation frequency is given by\n\n$$f = 1/\\tau = v_d / L$$\n\nwhere $v_d$ is the average drift velocity and $L$ is the length of the drift region.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Graph](image1.png)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 15.6** (a) Electron concentration versus distance showing a domain. (b) Electric field versus distance.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Graph](image2.png)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 15.7** Current pulses versus time in the GaAs device.\n\nThe oscillation mechanism just described is called the transit-time mode. More complex modes of operation are possible. Studies have shown that the efficiency of the transit-time device is largest when the product \\( n_0 L \\) is a few times \\( 10^{12} \\text{ cm}^{-2} \\). For this case, the domain fills about one-half of the drift region length and produces a current output that is nearly sinusoidal. The maximum dc-to-rf conversion efficiency is approximately 10 percent.\n\nOscillations in the frequency range of 1 to 100 GHz or higher can be obtained. If the device is operated in a pulsed mode, a peak output power in the range of hundreds of watts can be produced. Transferred-electron devices are now used as the microwave source in many radar systems."}, {"id": 668, "content": "**15.3 | IMPATT DIODE**\n\nThe term **IMPATT** stands for **IMP**act **I**onization **A**valanche **T**ransit-**T**ime. The IMPATT diode consists of a high-field avalanche region and a drift region that produces a dynamic negative resistance at microwave frequencies. The negative resistance characteristic produced in this device is a result of a time delay so that the ac current and voltage components are out of phase, and is a different phenomenon compared to the tunnel diode, for example. The tunnel diode has a negative \\( dI/dV \\) region in the \\( I-V \\) characteristic.\n\nOne example of an IMPATT diode is a \\( \\text{p}^+ \\text{-n-i-n}^- \\) structure as shown in Figure 15.8a.

An LC resonant circuit is required for the oscillator operation. During the positive ac voltage across the LC circuit as shown in the figure, the diode goes into breakdown and electron-hole pairs are generated at the p+ n junction. The generated electrons flow back into the p+ region, while the holes start drifting through the depleted intrinsic region. In general, the holes will travel at their saturation velocity. During the negative ac voltage, the device operates below the breakdown voltage so electron-hole pairs are no longer produced.\n\nThere is an inherent \u03c0/2 phase shift between the peak value of the avalanche voltage at the p+ n junction and the injection of the holes into the intrinsic drift region due to the finite buildup time of the avalanche generated electron-hole pairs. A further delay of \u03c0/2 is then required during the drift process to provide the total 180 degrees of phase shift between the current and voltage at the output terminal. The transit time of the holes is \u03c4 = L/v, where L is the length of the drift region and v is the saturation velocity of the holes. The LC circuit resonant frequency must be designed to be equal to the device resonant frequency, which is given by\n\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} = \\frac{v}{2L}$$\n\nWhen the holes reach the n+ cathode, the current is at a maximum value and the voltage is at its minimum value. The ac current and ac voltage are 180 degrees out of phase with respect to each other producing the dynamic negative resistance.\n\nDevices can be designed to operate in the 100 GHz or higher frequency range and produce power outputs of a few watts. The efficiency of these devices is in the range of 10 to 15 percent, and these devices provide the highest continuous output power of all the semiconductor microwave devices.

In the vertical configuration for the power bipolar transistor, the collector terminal is at the \u201cbottom\u201d of the device. This configuration is preferred since it maximizes the cross-sectional area through which current is flowing in the device.

Another n region, with a higher doping concentration, reduces collector resistance and makes contact with the external collector terminal.

In the common-emitter configuration, the breakdown voltage mechanism also involves the transistor gain, as well as the breakdown phenomenon in the pn junction. This is discussed in Section 12.4.6.

All the curves tend to merge to the same collector\u2013emitter voltage once breakdown has occurred. This voltage, \\( V_{CE,\\text{max}} \\), is the minimum voltage necessary to sustain the transistor in breakdown.\n\nAnother breakdown effect is called **second breakdown**, which occurs in a BJT operating at high voltage and high current. Slight nonuniformities in current density produce local regions of increased heating that increases the minority carrier concentrations in the semiconductor material, which in turn increases the current in these regions. This effect results in positive feedback, and the current continues to increase, producing a further increase in temperature, until the semiconductor material may actually melt, creating a short circuit between the collector and emitter.\n\nThe average power dissipated in a BJT must be kept below a specified maximum value, to ensure that the temperature of the device remains below a maximum value.

However, the current handling capability of these devices is usually in the ampere range, and the drain-to-source blocking voltage may be in the range of 50 to 100 volts or even higher. One big advantage that a power MOSFET has over a bipolar power device is that the control signal is applied to the gate whose input impedance is extremely large. Even during switching between on and off states, the gate current is small, so that relatively large currents can be switched with very small control currents."}, {"id": 674, "content": "## 15.5.1 Power Transistor Structures\n\nLarge currents can be obtained in a MOSFET with a very large channel width. To achieve a large channel width device with good characteristics, power MOSFETs are fabricated with a repetitive pattern of small cells operating in parallel. To achieve a large blocking voltage, a vertical structure is used. There are two basic power MOSFET structures. The first is called a DMOS device and is shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 15.20<|end_image|>. The DMOS device uses a double diffusion process: The p-base or the p-substrate region and the n+ source contact are diffused through a common window defined by the edge of the gate. The p-base region is diffused deeper than the n+ source, and the difference in the lateral diffusion distance between the p-base and the n+ source defines the surface channel length. Electrons enter the source terminal and flow laterally through the inversion layer under the gate to the n-drift region. The electrons then flow vertically through the n-drift region to the drain terminal. The conventional current direction is from the drain to the source. The n-drift region must be moderately doped so that the drain breakdown voltage is sufficiently large. However, the thickness of the n-drift region should also be as thin as possible to minimize drain resistance.\n\nThe second power MOSFET structure, shown in <|begin_image|>Figure 15.21<|end_image|>, is a VMOS structure. The vertical channel MOS (VMOS) power device is a nonplanar structure that requires a different type of fabrication process. In this case, a p-base or p-\u201csubstrate\u201d diffusion is performed over the entire surface followed by the n+ source diffusion. A V-shaped groove is then formed, extending through the n-drift region. It has been found that certain chemical solutions etch the (111) planes in silicon at a much slower rate than the other planes. If (100) oriented silicon is etched through a window at the surface, these chemical etches will create a V-shaped groove. A gate oxide is then grown in the V-shaped groove and the metal gate material is deposited. An electron inversion layer is formed in the base or substrate so that current is again essentially a vertical current between the source and the drain. The relatively low-doped n-drift region supports the drain voltage since the depletion region extends mainly into this low-doped region.\n\nWe mentioned that many individual MOSFET cells are connected in parallel to fabricate a power MOSFET with the proper width-to-length ratio. <|begin_image|>Figure 15.22<|end_image|> shows a HEXFET structure. Each cell is a DMOS device with an n+ polysilicon gate. The HEXFET has a very high packing density\u2014it may be on the order of 10^6 cells per cm^2. In the VMOS structure, the anisotropic etching of the grooves must be along the [110] direction on the (100) surface.

The drain currents are in the ampere range and the breakdown voltages are in the hundreds of volts range.\n\nAn important parameter of a power MOSFET is the **on resistance**, which can be written as\n\n$$R_{on} = R_s + R_{ch} + R_d$$\n\n(15.9)\n\nwhere $R_s$ is the resistance associated with the source contact, $R_{ch}$ is the channel resistance, and $R_d$ is the resistance associated with the drain contact. The $R_s$ and $R_d$ resistance values are not necessarily negligible in power MOSFETs since small resistances and high currents can produce considerable power dissipation.\n\nIn the linear region of operation, we may write the channel resistance as\n\n$$\nR_{ch} = \\frac{L}{W \\mu_n C_{ox}(V_{GS} - V_t)}\n$$\n\n(15.10)\n\nWe have noted in previous chapters that mobility decreases with increasing temperature. The threshold voltage varies only slightly with temperature so that, as current in a device increases and produces additional power dissipation, the temperature of the device increases, the carrier mobility decreases, and R<sub>ch</sub> increases, which inherently limits the channel current. The resistances R<sub>s</sub> and R<sub>d</sub> are proportional to semiconductor resistivity and so are also inversely proportional to mobility and have the same temperature characteristics as R<sub>ch</sub>. <|begin_image|>Figure 15.23<|end_image|> shows a typical \u201con-resistance\u201d characteristic as a function of drain current.\n\nThe increase in resistance with temperature provides stability for the power MOSFET. If the current in any particular cell begins to increase, the resulting temperature rise will increase the resistance, thus limiting the current. With this particular characteristic, the total current in a power MOSFET tends to be evenly distributed among the parallel cells, not concentrated in any single cell, a condition that can cause burnout.\n\n<|begin_image|>Figure 15.24<|end_image|> Typical characteristics for high-power MOSFETs at various temperatures: (a) transconductance versus drain current; (b) drain current versus gate-to-source voltage.\n\nPower MOSFETs differ from bipolar power transistors in both operating principles and performance. The superior performance characteristics of power MOSFETs are faster switching times, no second breakdown, and stable gain and response time over a wide temperature range. <|begin_image|>Figure 15.24a<|end_image|> shows the transconductance of the 2N6757 versus temperature.

We may note that at high current, the current decreases with temperature at a constant gate-to-source voltage, providing the stability that has been discussed.\n\nPower MOSFETs must operate in a SOA. As with power BJTs, the SOA is defined by three factors, the maximum drain current, \\(I_{D,\\text{max}}\\), rated breakdown voltage, \\(BV_{DS}\\), and the maximum power dissipation given by \\(P_T = V_{DS}I_D\\).

The parasitic BJT may be seen in both the DMOS and VMOS structures shown in Figures 15.20 and 15.21. The source terminal corresponds to the n-type emitter, the p-type base or substrate region corresponds to the p-type base, and the n-type drain corresponds to the n-type collector. This is also shown schematically in Figure 15.28. The channel length of the MOSFET corresponds to the base width of the parasitic BJT.

We see from the geometries of Figures 15.20 and 15.21 that the source ohmic contact also goes across the p-type body region so that this function voltage is zero during steady-state operation of the transistor. However, the BJT may be turned on during high-speed switching of the MOSFET.\n\nFigure 15.28b shows that the base and the collector of the parasitic BJT are connected by the gate-to-drain capacitance. A parasitic or distributed resistance also connects the base to the emitter of the BJT. When the MOSFET is being turned off, the drain-to-source voltage increases and induces a current in the gate-to-drain capacitance in the direction from the parasitic collector terminal to the parasitic base terminal. This induced current may be large enough to induce a voltage in the parasitic resistance that is sufficient to forward bias the base-emitter junction and therefore turn the BJT on. The turned on BJT may then induce a large drain current that can cause burnout of the MOSFET. This breakdown mechanism is known as **snapback breakdown** and has been discussed briefly in Section 11.4.1.The current\u2013voltage characteristics are shown in Figure 11.22.

Thyristor is the name given to a general class of semiconductor pnpn switching devices that exhibit bistable regenerative switching characteristics. We have considered the transistor, which may be switched on with the application of a base drive or a gate voltage. The base drive or gate voltage must be applied as long as the transistor is to remain on. There are a number of applications in which it is useful to have a device remain in a blocking state until switched to the low-impedance state by a control signal, which then does not necessarily have to remain on. These devices are efficient in switching large currents at low frequencies, such as industrial control circuits operating at 60 Hz.\n\nA Semiconductor Controlled Rectifier (SCR) is the common name given to a three-terminal thyristor. The SCR (sometimes referred to as a silicon controlled rectifier) is a four-layer pnpn structure with a gate control terminal. As with most semiconductor devices, there are several variations of the device structure. We consider the basic SCR operation and limitations, and then discuss some variations of the basic four-layer device."}, {"id": 679, "content": "#### 15.6.1 The Basic Characteristics\nThe four-layer pnpn structure is shown in Figure 15.29a. The upper p region is called the anode and the lower n region is called the cathode. If a positive voltage is applied to the anode, the device is said to be forward biased. However, the junction J3 is reverse biased so that only a very small current exists. If a negative voltage is applied to the anode, then junctions J1 and J2 are reverse biased\u2014again only a very small current will exist. Figure 15.29b shows the I\u2013V characteristics for these conditions. The voltage Vb is the breakdown voltage of the J3 junction. For properly designed devices, the blocking voltage can be several thousand volts.\n\nTo consider the characteristics of the device as it goes into its conducting state, we can model the structure as coupled npn and pnp bipolar transistors. Figure 15.30a shows how we can split the four-layer structure and Figure 15.30b shows the two-transistor equivalent circuit with the associated currents. Since the base of the pnp device is the same as the collector of the npn transistor, the base current Ib1 must in fact be the same as the collector current Ic2. Similarly, since the collector of the pnp transistor is the same as the base of the npn device, the collector current Ic1 must be the same as the base current Ib2. In this bias configuration, the B\u2013C of the pnp and the B\u2013C of the npn devices are reverse biased, while the B\u2013E junctions are both forward biased. The parameters \u03b11 and \u03b12 are the common base current gains of the pnp and npn transistors, respectively.\n\n![Diagram of a four-layer pnpn structure](image1.png)\n\n**Figure 15.29** [(a) The basic four-layer pnpn structure.

In this particular configuration, I_a = I_c and I_c1 + I_c2 = I_a. If we add Equations (15.11a) and (15.11b), we obtain\n\nI_c1 + I_c2 = I_a = (\u03b1_1 + \u03b1_2) I_a + I_c01 + I_c02 (15.12)\n\nThe anode current I_a from Equation (15.12), can be found as\n\nI_a = I_c01 + I_c02 / (1 - (\u03b1_1 + \u03b1_2)) (15.13)\n\nAs long as (\u03b1_1 + \u03b1_2) is much smaller than unity, the anode current is small, as we have indicated in Figure 15.29b.\n\nThe common base current gains, \u03b1_1 and \u03b1_2, are very strong functions of collector current as we discussed in Chapter 12. For small values of V_A, the collector current in each device is just the reverse saturation current, which is very small. The small collector current implies that both \u03b1_1 and \u03b1_2 are much smaller than unity. The four-layer structure maintains this blocking condition until the junction J_2 starts into breakdown or until a current is induced in the J_3 junction by some external means.\n\nConsider, initially, the condition when the applied anode voltage is sufficiently large to cause the J_2 junction to start into avalanche breakdown. This effect is shown in Figure 15.31a. The electrons generated by impact ionization are swept into the n_1 region, making the n_1 region more negative, and the holes generated by impact ionization are swept into the p_2 region, making the p_2 region more positive. The more negative voltage of the n_1 region and the more positive voltage of the p_2 region means that the forward-bias junction voltages V_1 and V_2 both increase. The increase in the respective B-E junction voltages causes an increase in current, which results in an increase in the common-base current gains \u03b1_1 and \u03b1_2, causing a further increase in\n\n![Figure 15.31](image_url)\n\n**Figure 15.31** | (a) The pnpn device when the J_2 junction starts into avalanche breakdown.

The turn-on condition can also be initiated by other means. Figure 15.33a shows three-terminal SCR in which the third terminal is the gate control. We can determine the effect of the gate current by reconsidering Equations (15.11a) and (15.11b).\n\nFigure 15.33b again shows the two-transistor equivalent circuit including the gate current. We can write\n\nI_C1 = \u03b1_1I_A + I_C01 (15.14a)\n\nand\n\nI_C2 = \u03b1_2I_K + I_C02 (15.14b)\n\nWe now have I_K = I_g + I_s and we can still write I_C1 + I_C2 = I_A. Adding Equations (15.14a) and (15.14b), we find that\n\nI_C1 + I_C2 = I_A \u2261 (\u03b1_1 + \u03b1_2)I_A + \u03b1_2I_g + I_C01 + I_C02 (15.15)\n\nSolving for \\( I_A \\), we find\n\n\\[ I_A = \\frac{\\alpha_2 I_p + (I_{r_{n1}} + I_{r_{n2}})}{1 - (\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2)} \\tag{15.16} \\]\n\nWe can think of the gate current as the flow of holes into the \\( p_2 \\) region. The additional holes increase the potential of this region, which increases the forward-biased B-E voltage of the npn bipolar transistor, and the transistor action. The transistor action of the npn increases the collector current \\( I_{c_2} \\), which starts the transistor action of the pnp bipolar transistor, and the entire pnpn device can be turned on into its low-impedance state. The gate current required to switch the SCR into its on condition is typically in the milliamps range. SCR can be turned on with a small gate current, which can control hundreds of amperes of anode current. The gate current can be turned off and the SCR will remain in its conducting state. The gate loses control of the device once the SCR is triggered into its conducting state. The current\u2013voltage characteristics of the SCR as a function of gate current is shown in Figure 15.34.\n\nA simple application of an SCR in a half-wave control circuit is shown in Figure 15.35a. The input signal is an ac voltage and a trigger pulse will control the turn-on of the SCR. We assume that the trigger pulse occurs at time \\( t_1 \\) during the ac voltage cycle. Prior to \\( t_1 \\), the SCR is off so that the current in the load is zero; thus, there is a zero output voltage. At \\( t = t_1 \\), the SCR is triggered on and the input voltage appears across the load (neglecting the voltage drop across the SCR). The SCR turns off when the anode-to-cathode voltage becomes zero even though the trigger pulse has been turned off prior to this time. The time at which the SCR is triggered during the voltage cycle can be varied, changing the amount of power delivered to the load. Full-wave control circuits can be designed to increase efficiency and degree of control."}, {"id": 681, "content": "The gate allows control of the turn-on of the SCR. However, the four-layer pnpn structure can also be triggered on by other means. In many integrated circuits, parasitic pnpn structures exist. One such example is the CMOS structure that we considered in Chapter 10. A transient ionizing radiation pulse can trigger the parasitic\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 15.34](image_url)<|end_image|> | Current\u2013voltage characteristics of an SCR.\n\n**Figure 15.35** (a) Simple SCR circuit.

The photocurrent is equivalent to a gate current in an SCR so the parasitic device can be switched into its conducting state. Again, once the device is switched on, it will remain in its conducting state even when the radiation ceases. An optical signal can also trigger the device in the same manner by generating electron\u2013hole pairs.\n\nAnother triggering mechanism in the pnpn device is $dV/dt$ triggering. If the forward-bias anode voltage is applied rapidly, the voltage across the $J_2$ junction will also change quickly. This changing reverse-biased $J_2$ junction voltage means that the space charge region width is increasing; thus, electrons are being removed from the $n_1$ side of the junction and holes are being removed from the $p_2$ side of the junction. If dV/dt is large, the rate of removal of these carriers is rapid, which leads to a large transient current that is equivalent to a gate current and can trigger the device into a low-impedance conducting state. In SCR devices, a dV/dt rating is usually specified. However, in parasitic pnpn structures, the dV/dt triggering mechanism is a potential problem."}, {"id": 682, "content": "### 15.6.3 SCR Turn-Off\n\nSwitching the four-layer pnpn structure from its conducting state to its blocking state can be accomplished if the current I1 is reduced below the value creating the \u03b11 + \u03b12 = 1 condition. This critical I1 current is called the holding current. If a parasitic four-layer structure is triggered into the conducting state, the effective anode current in the device must be reduced below the corresponding holding current in order to turn off the device. This requirement essentially implies that all power supplies must be turned off in order to bring the parasitic device back into its blocking state.\n\nThe SCR can be triggered on by supplying holes to the p1 region of the device. The SCR can perhaps be turned off by removing holes from this same region. If the reverse gate current is large enough to bring the npn bipolar transistor out of saturation, then the SCR can be switched from the conducting state into the blocking state. However, the lateral dimensions of the device may be large enough so that nonuniform biasing in the J1 and J2 junctions occurs during a negative gate current and the device will remain in the low-impedance conducting state. The four-layer pnpn device must be specifically designed for a turn-off capability."}, {"id": 683, "content": "### 15.6.4 Device Structures\n\nMany thyristor structures have been fabricated with specific characteristics for specific applications. We consider a few of these types of device to gain an appreciation for the variety of structures.\n\n**Basic SCR** There are many variations of diffusion, implantation, and epitaxial growth that can be used in the fabrication of the SCR device. The basic structure is shown in Figure 15.36. The p1 and p2 regions are diffused into a fairly high resistivity n1 material. The n+ cathode is formed and the p+ gate contact is made. High thermal conductivity materials can be used for the anode and cathode ohmic contacts to aid in heat dissipation for high-power devices. The n1 region width may be on the order of 250 \u03bcm in order to support very large reverse-biased voltages across the J2 junction. The p1 and p2 regions may be on the order of 75 \u03bcm wide, while the n+ and p+ regions are normally quite thin.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 15.36](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Bilateral Thyristor** Since thyristors are often used in ac power applications, it may be useful to have a device that switches symmetrically in the positive and negative cycles of the ac voltage. There are a number of such devices, but the basic concept is to connect two conventional thyristors in antiparallel as shown in Figure 15.37a. The integration of this concept into a single device is shown in Figure 15.37b. Symmetrical n regions can be diffused into a pnp structure. Figure 15.37c shows the current\u2013voltage characteristics in which the triggering into the conduction mode\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 15.37](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 15.37** (a) The antiparallel connection of two thyristors to form a bilateral device.

The two terminals alternately share the role of anode and cathode during successive half cycles of the ac voltage.\n\nTriggering by a gate control is more complex for this device since a single gate region must serve for both of the antiparallel thyristors. One such device is known as a triac. Figure 15.38a shows the cross section of such a device. This device can be triggered into conduction by gate signals of either polarity and with anode-to-cathode voltages of either polarity.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 15.38](a) The triac device. (b) The triac with a specific bias configuration. (From Ghandhi [7].)<|end_image|>\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 15.39](The current\u2013voltage characteristics of the triac.)<|end_image|>\n\nOne particular gate control situation is shown in Figure 15.38b. Terminal 1 is positive with respect to terminal 2, and a negative gate voltage is applied with respect to terminal 1, so the gate current is negative. This polarity arrangement induces the current I_1 and the junction J_4 becomes forward biased. Electrons are injected from n_5, diffuse across p_2, and are collected in the n_1 region. In this case n_1p_1n_1 behaves like a saturated transistor. The collected electrons in n_1 lower the potential of n_1 with respect to p_2. The current across the p_2n_1 junction increases, which can trigger the p_2n_1p_1n_1 thyristor into its conducting mode.\n\nWe can show that the other combinations of gate, anode, and cathode voltages will also trigger the triac into conduction. Figure 15.39 shows the terminal characteristics.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 15.40](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 15.40 | The V groove MOS gated thyristor.**\n\n*(From Buliga [1])*"}, {"id": 684, "content": "### MOS Gated Thyristor\n\nThe operation of a MOS gated thyristor is based upon controlling the gain of the npn bipolar transistor. Figure 15.40 shows a V-groove MOS gated thyristor. The MOS gate structure must extend into the n-drift region. If the gate voltage is zero, the depletion edge in the p-base remains essentially flat and parallel to the junction J2; the gain of the npn transistor is low. This effect is shown in the figure by the dashed line. When a positive gate voltage is applied, the surface of the p base becomes depleted\u2014the depletion region in the p base adjacent to the gate is shown by the dotted line. The undepleted base width Wp of the npn bipolar device narrows and the gain of the device increases.\n\nAt a gate voltage approximately equal to the threshold voltage, electrons from the n+ emitter are injected through the depletion region into the n-drift region. The potential of the n-drift region is lowered, which further forward biases the p+ anode to n-drift junction voltage, and the regenerative process is initiated. The gate voltage required to initiate turn-on is approximately the threshold voltage of the MOS device. One advantage of this device is that the input impedance to the control terminal is very high; relatively large currents can be switched with very small capacity coupled gate currents."}, {"id": 685, "content": "### MOS Turn-Off Thyristor\n\nThe MOS turn-off thyristor can both turn on and turn off the anode current by applying a signal to a MOS gate terminal. The basic device structure is shown in Figure 15.41. By applying a positive gate voltage, the n+pn bipolar transistor can be turned on as just discussed. Once the thyristor is turned on, the device can be turned off by applying a negative gate voltage; the negative gate voltage turns on the p-channel MOS transistor that effectively short circuits the B-E junction of the n+pn bipolar transistor. Holes that now enter the p-base have an alternative path to the cathode. If the resistance of the p-channel MOSFET becomes low enough, all current will be diverted away from the n+ p emitter and the n+pn device will effectively be turned off.\n\n<|begin_image|>![Figure 15.41](image_url)<|end_image|>\n\n**Figure 15.41** [(a) The MOS turn-off thyristor.
