### Context:
### 2.1.2 Wave–Particle Duality

We have seen in the last section that light waves, in the photoelectric effect, behave as if they are particles. The particle-like behavior of electromagnetic waves was also instrumental in the explanation of the Compton effect. In this experiment, an x-ray beam was incident on a solid. A portion of the x-ray beam was deflected and the frequency of the deflected wave had shifted compared with the incident wave. The observed change in frequency and the deflected angle corresponded exactly to the expected results of a “billard ball” collision between an x-ray quanta, or photon, and an electron in which both energy and momentum are conserved.

In 1924, de Broglie postulated the existence of matter waves. He suggested that since waves exhibit particle-like behavior, particles should be expected to show wave-like properties. The hypothesis of de Broglie was the existence of a wave-particle duality principle. The momentum of a photon is given by

$$
p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
$$

(2.2)

where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the light wave. Then, de Broglie hypothesized that the wavelength of a particle can be expressed as

$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$

(2.3)

where \(p\) is the momentum of the particle and \(\lambda\) is known as the de Broglie wavelength of the matter wave.

The wave nature of electrons has been tested in several ways. In one experiment by Davisson and Germer in 1927, electrons from a heated filament were accelerated at normal incidence onto a single crystal of nickel. A detector measured the scattered electrons as a function of angle. Figure 2.2 shows the experimental setup and Figure 2.3 shows the results. The existence of a peak in the density of scattered electrons can be explained as a constructive interference of waves scattered by the periodic atoms in the planes of the nickel crystal. The angular distribution is very similar to an interference pattern produced by light diffracted from a grating.

In order to gain some appreciation of the frequencies and wavelengths involved in the wave-particle duality principle, Figure 2.4 shows the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. We see that a wavelength of 72.7 Å obtained in the next example is in the ultraviolet range. Typically, we will be considering wavelengths in the

ultraviolet and visible range. These wavelengths are very short compared to the usual radio spectrum range.

**Objective:** Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a particle.

Consider an electron traveling at a velocity of 10^7 cm/s = 10^3 m/s.

- **Solution**

  The momentum is given by

  p = mv = (9.11 x 10^-31)(10^3) = 9.11 x 10^-28 kg·m/s

  Then, the de Broglie wavelength is

  λ = h/p = 6.625 x 10^-34 / 9.11 x 10^-28 = 7.27 x 10^-9 m

**2.1 | THE WAVE–PARTICLE DUALITY PRINCIPLE**

In some cases, electromagnetic waves behave as if they are particles (photons) and sometimes particles behave as if they are waves. This wave–particle duality principle of quantum mechanics applies primarily to small particles such as electrons, but it has also been shown to apply to protons and neutrons. For very large particles, we can show that the relevant equations reduce to those of classical mechanics. The wave–particle duality principle is the basis on which we will use wave theory to describe the motion and behavior of electrons in a crystal.

**λ = 72.7 Å**

- **Comment**

This calculation shows the order of magnitude of the de Broglie wavelength for a “typical” electron.

- **EXERCISE PROBLEM**

**Ex 2.2** (a) An electron has a kinetic energy of 12 meV. Determine the de Broglie wavelength (in Å). (b) A particle with mass 2.2 x 10^-31 kg has a de Broglie wavelength of 112 Å. Determine the momentum and kinetic energy of the particle. [A9, 01 x 16 ½ = 7 ¼ suV]

An electron microscope is a microscope that produces a magnified image of a specimen. The electron microscope has a magnification approximately 1000 times that of an optical microscope, because the electrons have wavelengths on the order of 100,000 times shorter than the light waves.

### Instruction:
Solve the following question:
(a) The wavelength of green light is λ = 550 nm. If an electron has the same wave-length, determine the electron velocity and momentum. (b) Repeat part (a) for the light with a wavelength of λ = 440 nm. (c) For parts (a) and (b), is the photon equal to the momentum of the electron?
By doing the following:
First, reflect on the question (without actually solving it or doing any math) and the context shown above and determine the correct approach/strategy to solving it.
Then, solve the question step by step. If you ever need to solve an equation or calculate the value of an expression, utilize function calling by writing sympy code. But before writing code, plan out what variables will be used and what equations/expressions will be solved, and what should be printed out.
When writing your code block, make sure to define all variables used and use print statements as variables won't be displayed automatically, ie, write ``print(solution)`` instead of ``solution``.
After you output code, I will go and run the code and report whatever is printed to console, like this:
```output
5```
Reflect upon the results and see if they make sense, and continue with the next step as needed. If there is an error, analyze the code and the error and think of ways to fix the error. Then output new code. If you fail to fix the error, think of an alternative way to solve the problem.
Note that after I run the code, I will wipe the memory. Therefor, previously defined symbols and variables will be erased and must be redefined in the next code block you write. For instance, if you found that m=5 in the last code block, you must redefine m=5 in the new code block you write.
Finally, after solving the problem, output "Answer:", followed by the answer.
