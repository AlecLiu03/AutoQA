To solve the problem of a particle in a finite potential well, we will break it down into the specified parts: setting up the wave function equations for the three distinct regions, identifying boundary conditions, deriving the expression for wave number constraints, and conceptualizing the wave functions.

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### Part a: Set up the wave function equations for the three distinct regions

1. **Region I (x < 0)**: The potential \( V(x) = V_0 \) (finite potential). The time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{d^2\psi_I}{dx^2} + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E - V_0)\psi_I = 0
   \]
   If \( E < V_0 \), we define \( k_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2m(V_0 - E)}{\hbar^2}} \) and the general solution is:
   \[
   \psi_I(x) = A e^{-k_1 x} + B e^{k_1 x}
   \]
   (where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants).

2. **Region II (0 < x < a)**: The potential \( V(x) = 0 \). The equation simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{d^2\psi_{II}}{dx^2} + \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi_{II} = 0
   \]
   We define \( k_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \) and the general solution is:
   \[
   \psi_{II}(x) = C \sin(k_2 x) + D \cos(k_2 x)
   \]

3. **Region III (x > a)**: The potential \( V(x) = V_0 \). The equation is similar to Region I:
   \[
   \frac{d^2\psi_{III}}{dx^2} + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E - V_0)\psi_{III} = 0
   \]
   Again, if \( E < V_0 \), we have:
   \[
   \psi_{III}(x) = F e^{-k_1 x} + G e^{k_1 x}
   \]
   (where \( F \) and \( G \) are constants).

#### Part b: Boundary Conditions

The boundary conditions at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = a \) are:
1. Continuity of the wave function:
   \[
   \psi_I(0) = \psi_{II}(0) \quad \text{and} \quad \psi_{II}(a) = \psi_{III}(a)
   \]
2. Continuity of the first derivative of the wave function:
   \[
   \frac{d\psi_I}{dx}\bigg|_{x=0} = \frac{d\psi_{II}}{dx}\bigg|_{x=0} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{d\psi_{II}}{dx}\bigg|_{x=a} = \frac{d\psi_{III}}{dx}\bigg|_{x=a}
   \]

#### Part c: Expression for wave number constraints

Using the boundary conditions, we can derive the relationship between \( k_1 \) and \( k_2 \). At \( x = 0 \):
\[
A + D = C
\]
At \( x = a \):
\[
C \sin(k_2 a) + D \cos(k_2 a) = F e^{-k_1 a} + G e^{k_1 a}
\]

Using the continuity of the derivatives, we can derive:
\[
k_2 C \cos(k_2 a) - k_2 D \sin(k_2 a) = -k_1 F e^{-k_1 a} + k_1 G e^{k_1 a}
\]

From these equations, we can derive the expression:
\[
\tan(k_2 a) = \frac{k_1}{k_2}
\]

#### Part d: Conceptualization

For the sketching part, we will qualitatively describe the wave functions:

1. **Finite Potential Well**: The wave functions will have some amplitude outside the well (decaying exponentially) and will have a sinusoidal form inside the well. The energy levels will be quantized but will not have the same sharp nodes as in the infinite well.

2. **Infinite Potential Well**: The wave functions will be strictly zero outside the well and will have a sinusoidal form with nodes at the boundaries. The energy levels will be more sharply defined.

### Code Implementation

Now, let's implement the mathematical expressions derived above using SymPy for further analysis.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
m, hbar, E, V0, a = sp.symbols('m hbar E V0 a')
k1 = sp.sqrt(2 * m * (V0 - E) / hbar**2)
k2 = sp.sqrt(2 * m * E / hbar**2)

# Derive the expression for tan(ka)
tan_expression = sp.tan(k2 * a) - (k1 / k2)

# Print the expression
print(tan_expression)
```
```output
tan(sqrt(2)*a*sqrt(E*m/hbar**2)) - sqrt(m*(-E + V0)/hbar**2)/sqrt(E*m/hbar**2)
```
The output from the code gives us the expression that describes how the wave number is constrained in order to yield solutions to the wave equation. The expression is:

\[
\tan\left(\sqrt{2} a \sqrt{\frac{E m}{\hbar^2}}\right) - \frac{\sqrt{m (V_0 - E)}}{\sqrt{E m}} = 0
\]

This expression can be rearranged to yield the relationship:

\[
\tan(k_2 a) = \frac{k_1}{k_2}
\]

where \( k_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2m(V_0 - E)}{\hbar^2}} \) and \( k_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \).

### Summary of Results

1. **Wave Function Equations**:
   - Region I: \( \psi_I(x) = A e^{-k_1 x} + B e^{k_1 x} \)
   - Region II: \( \psi_{II}(x) = C \sin(k_2 x) + D \cos(k_2 x) \)
   - Region III: \( \psi_{III}(x) = F e^{-k_1 x} + G e^{k_1 x} \)

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Continuity of wave function and its first derivative at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = a \).

3. **Wave Number Constraint**:
   - The derived expression is:
   \[
   \tan(k_2 a) = \frac{k_1}{k_2}
   \]

4. **Conceptualization**:
   - The wave functions for the finite potential well will have exponential decay outside the well and sinusoidal behavior inside, while the infinite potential well will have strictly zero wave functions outside and well-defined nodes.

### Final Answer

Answer: The expression that describes how the wave number is constrained in order to yield solutions to the wave equation is:

\[
\tan(k_2 a) = \frac{k_1}{k_2}
\] 

where \( k_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2m(V_0 - E)}{\hbar^2}} \) and \( k_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \).
