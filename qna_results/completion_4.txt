To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the electron in specified regions of the potential well. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{a}\right) \quad \text{for } -\frac{a}{2} < x < \frac{a}{2}
\]

The probability of finding the electron in a specific region is given by the integral of the square of the wave function over that region:

\[
P(x_1 < x < x_2) = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx
\]

### Step-by-step Plan:

1. **Define the wave function**: We will define the wave function \(\psi(x)\) in terms of \(a\).
2. **Calculate probabilities for the specified intervals**:
   - (a) For \(0 < x < \frac{a}{4}\)
   - (b) For \(\frac{a}{4} < x < \frac{a}{2}\)
   - (c) For \(-\frac{a}{2} < x < \frac{a}{2}\)
3. **Set up the integrals** for each of the specified intervals.
4. **Use SymPy** to compute the integrals and print the results.

### Variables and Equations:
- Let \(a\) be the width of the potential well (we will keep it symbolic for now).
- The wave function is \(\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi x}{a}\right)\).
- The probability for each interval will be calculated using the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\).

Now, let's write the code to perform these calculations.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
a = sp.symbols('a')

# Define the wave function
x = sp.symbols('x')
psi = sp.sqrt(2/a) * sp.cos(sp.pi * x / a)

# Define the probabilities for the specified intervals
# (a) 0 < x < a/4
P_a = sp.integrate(psi**2, (x, 0, a/4))

# (b) a/4 < x < a/2
P_b = sp.integrate(psi**2, (x, a/4, a/2))

# (c) -a/2 < x < a/2
P_c = sp.integrate(psi**2, (x, -a/2, a/2))

# Print the results
print("P(0 < x < a/4):", P_a)
print("P(a/4 < x < a/2):", P_b)
print("P(-a/2 < x < a/2):", P_c)
```
```output
P(0 < x < a/4): Piecewise((2*(1/4 + pi/8)/pi, (a > -oo) & (a < oo) & Ne(a, 0)), (1/2, True))
P(a/4 < x < a/2): Piecewise((-2*(1/4 + pi/8)/pi + 1/2, (a > -oo) & (a < oo) & Ne(a, 0)), (1/2, True))
P(-a/2 < x < a/2): Piecewise((1, (a > -oo) & (a < oo) & Ne(a, 0)), (2, True))
```
The results from the calculations are as follows:

1. **Probability for \(0 < x < \frac{a}{4}\)**:
   \[
   P(0 < x < \frac{a}{4}) = \frac{2(1/4 + \frac{\pi}{8})}{\pi}
   \]

2. **Probability for \(\frac{a}{4} < x < \frac{a}{2}\)**:
   \[
   P(\frac{a}{4} < x < \frac{a}{2}) = -\frac{2(1/4 + \frac{\pi}{8})}{\pi} + \frac{1}{2}
   \]

3. **Probability for \(-\frac{a}{2} < x < \frac{a}{2}\)**:
   \[
   P(-\frac{a}{2} < x < \frac{a}{2}) = 1
   \]

### Interpretation of Results:
- The total probability of finding the electron in the entire region \(-\frac{a}{2} < x < \frac{a}{2}\) is 1, which is expected since the wave function is normalized.
- The probabilities for the two specified intervals are expressed in terms of \(a\) and involve \(\pi\), which is consistent with the nature of the wave function.

### Next Steps:
To provide a numerical answer, we can evaluate the probabilities for a specific value of \(a\). Let's assume \(a = 12 \, \text{Å}\) (as per the context of the original problem). We will substitute this value into the expressions for \(P(0 < x < \frac{a}{4})\) and \(P(\frac{a}{4} < x < \frac{a}{2})\) to compute their numerical values.

Let's write the code for this calculation.

```python
# Define the specific value of a
a_value = 12  # in Ångströms

# Calculate the probabilities for the specified intervals with a = 12 Å
P_a_numeric = P_a.subs(a, a_value).evalf()
P_b_numeric = P_b.subs(a, a_value).evalf()

# Print the results
print("P(0 < x < a/4) with a = 12 Å:", P_a_numeric)
print("P(a/4 < x < a/2) with a = 12 Å:", P_b_numeric)
``````
```output

It seems that the variables \(P_a\) and \(P_b\) are not defined in the new code block because they were defined in the previous block. Since the memory is wiped after each execution, we need to redefine everything, including the wave function and the integrals.

Let's redefine the wave function, recalculate the probabilities for the specified intervals, and then evaluate them for \(a = 12 \, \text{Å}\).

Here’s the complete code to do that:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
a = sp.symbols('a')

# Define the wave function
x = sp.symbols('x')
psi = sp.sqrt(2/a) * sp.cos(sp.pi * x / a)

# Define the probabilities for the specified intervals
# (a) 0 < x < a/4
P_a = sp.integrate(psi**2, (x, 0, a/4))

# (b) a/4 < x < a/2
P_b = sp.integrate(psi**2, (x, a/4, a/2))

# (c) -a/2 < x < a/2
P_c = sp.integrate(psi**2, (x, -a/2, a/2))

# Define the specific value of a
a_value = 12  # in Ångströms

# Calculate the probabilities for the specified intervals with a = 12 Å
P_a_numeric = P_a.subs(a, a_value).evalf()
P_b_numeric = P_b.subs(a, a_value).evalf()
P_c_numeric = P_c.subs(a, a_value).evalf()

# Print the results
print("P(0 < x < a/4) with a = 12 Å:", P_a_numeric)
print("P(a/4 < x < a/2) with a = 12 Å:", P_b_numeric)
print("P(-a/2 < x < a/2) with a = 12 Å:", P_c_numeric)
```
```output
P(0 < x < a/4) with a = 12 Å: 0.409154943091895
P(a/4 < x < a/2) with a = 12 Å: 0.0908450569081047
P(-a/2 < x < a/2) with a = 12 Å: 1.00000000000000
```
The results from the calculations are as follows:

1. **Probability for \(0 < x < \frac{a}{4}\)**:
   \[
   P(0 < x < \frac{12}{4}) \approx 0.4092
   \]
   This means there is approximately a 40.92% chance of finding the electron in the interval from \(0\) to \(3 \, \text{Å}\).

2. **Probability for \(\frac{a}{4} < x < \frac{a}{2}\)**:
   \[
   P(\frac{12}{4} < x < \frac{12}{2}) \approx 0.0908
   \]
   This indicates about a 9.08% chance of finding the electron in the interval from \(3 \, \text{Å}\) to \(6 \, \text{Å}\).

3. **Probability for \(-\frac{a}{2} < x < \frac{a}{2}\)**:
   \[
   P(-6 < x < 6) = 1
   \]
   This confirms that the total probability of finding the electron within the entire well is 1, as expected.

### Conclusion:
The calculations are consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics, where the total probability across the defined region sums to 1, and the probabilities for specific intervals are less than or equal to 1.

**Answer:**
- \(P(0 < x < \frac{a}{4}) \approx 0.4092\)
- \(P(\frac{a}{4} < x < \frac{a}{2}) \approx 0.0908\)
- \(P(-\frac{a}{2} < x < \frac{a}{2}) = 1\)
