To solve the problem step by step, we will first outline our approach.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to calculate the first three energy levels of an electron in a one-dimensional infinite potential well with a width of 10 Å. After that, we will find the wavelength of a photon emitted when the electron transitions from the third energy level to the second.

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Equations
The energy levels for an electron in an infinite potential well are given by the formula:

\[
E_n = \frac{h^2 n^2 \pi^2}{2 m a^2}
\]

Where:
- \(E_n\) is the energy of the nth level,
- \(h\) is Planck's constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}\)),
- \(m\) is the mass of the electron (\(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\)),
- \(a\) is the width of the well (10 Å = \(10 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)),
- \(n\) is the quantum number (1, 2, 3,...).

### Step 3: Calculate Energy Levels
We will calculate the first three energy levels (\(E_1\), \(E_2\), and \(E_3\)) using the above formula.

### Step 4: Calculate Wavelength of Emitted Photon
When the electron transitions from \(E_3\) to \(E_2\), the energy difference will be:

\[
\Delta E = E_3 - E_2
\]

The wavelength of the emitted photon can be calculated using the equation:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E}
\]

Where \(c\) is the speed of light (\(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\)).

### Step 5: Write the Code
Now, I will write the code to perform these calculations.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Constants
h = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in Js
m = 9.11e-31   # mass of electron in kg
a = 10e-10     # width of the well in meters
c = 3e8        # speed of light in m/s

# Calculate energy levels
n = sp.symbols('n')
E_n = (h**2 * n**2 * sp.pi**2) / (2 * m * a**2)

# Calculate first three energy levels
E_1 = E_n.subs(n, 1)
E_2 = E_n.subs(n, 2)
E_3 = E_n.subs(n, 3)

# Calculate energy difference for the transition
delta_E = E_3 - E_2

# Calculate wavelength of emitted photon
wavelength = (h * c) / delta_E

# Print results
print(f"E_1: {E_1.evalf()} J, E_2: {E_2.evalf()} J, E_3: {E_3.evalf()} J")
print(f"Wavelength of emitted photon: {wavelength.evalf()} m")
```
```output
E_1: 2.37823209546916E-18 J, E_2: 9.51292838187665E-18 J, E_3: 2.14040888592225E-17 J
Wavelength of emitted photon: 1.67166190699975E-8 m
```
The output provides the energy levels and the wavelength of the emitted photon:

1. **Energy Levels:**
   - \(E_1 \approx 2.38 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}\)
   - \(E_2 \approx 9.51 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}\)
   - \(E_3 \approx 2.14 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J}\)

2. **Wavelength of Emitted Photon:**
   - Wavelength \(\approx 1.67 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{m}\) or \(16.7 \, \text{nm}\).

### Step 6: Convert Energy Levels to eV
To express the energy levels in electron volts (eV), we can use the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\).

### Step 7: Write Code to Convert and Print Results
Now, I will write the code to convert the energy levels from joules to electron volts and print the results.

```python
# Conversion factor from Joules to eV
joules_to_eV = 1.6e-19

# Convert energy levels to eV
E_1_eV = E_1 / joules_to_eV
E_2_eV = E_2 / joules_to_eV
E_3_eV = E_3 / joules_to_eV

# Print energy levels in eV
print(f"E_1: {E_1_eV.evalf()} eV, E_2: {E_2_eV.evalf()} eV, E_3: {E_3_eV.evalf()} eV")
``````
```output

The error indicates that the variables \(E_1\), \(E_2\), and \(E_3\) are not defined in the new code block. This is because the previous variables were not retained after the last code execution.

### Step 1: Redefine Variables
I will redefine the constants and recalculate the energy levels before converting them to electron volts.

### Step 2: Write the Code to Redefine and Convert
Here’s the code that includes the necessary calculations and conversions:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Constants
h = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in Js
m = 9.11e-31   # mass of electron in kg
a = 10e-10     # width of the well in meters

# Calculate energy levels
n = sp.symbols('n')
E_n = (h**2 * n**2 * sp.pi**2) / (2 * m * a**2)

# Calculate first three energy levels
E_1 = E_n.subs(n, 1)
E_2 = E_n.subs(n, 2)
E_3 = E_n.subs(n, 3)

# Conversion factor from Joules to eV
joules_to_eV = 1.6e-19

# Convert energy levels to eV
E_1_eV = E_1 / joules_to_eV
E_2_eV = E_2 / joules_to_eV
E_3_eV = E_3 / joules_to_eV

# Print energy levels in eV
print(f"E_1: {E_1_eV.evalf()} eV, E_2: {E_2_eV.evalf()} eV, E_3: {E_3_eV.evalf()} eV")
