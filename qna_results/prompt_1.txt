### Context:
PROMPT: Problem #: 1a Question: Particle in a finite potential well: Setup the set of wave function equations for the three distinct regions in x In order to solve the differential equations in regions I and III, we have to assume something about if E>V0 or E<V0, in order to find the general form of the equation. I've looked it up online, and I found some things saying that the energy of a particle should be greater than the potential "floor" V0 because the energy must be higher than V0 in order to even get to Region I or III to begin with. Other sources say V0 must be higher than the energy because it is the minimum energy. I am not totally sure how to go forward in solving the equations for these regions of the well without knowing which assumption we should make when solving.
ANSWER: Since the particle is in the potential well, you can assume that the E inside the well is less than V0. Boundary conditions need to be applied in the problem to achieve a set of solvable simultaneous equations. . From this set of simultaneous equations, some of the coefficients will have trivial solutions resulting in a non-trivial relationship between k1 and k2 in the form of tan(ka).Classically, you would need E>V0 for the particle to exist outside the box (consider a classical wave, the peak would have to be larger than the containers wall for the wave to exit). However, in quantum mechanics, you can break this for a short distance as you'll see in part d. This is conceptually related to the uncertainty principle if you want to explore this further.

### 2.3.2 The Infinite Potential Well

The problem of a particle in the infinite potential well is a classic example of a bound particle. The potential V(x) as a function of position for this problem is shown in Figure 2.6. The particle is assumed to exist in region II, so the particle is contained within a finite region of space. The time-independent Schrodinger's wave equation is again given by Equation (2.13) as

$$\frac{\partial^2\psi(x)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(E - V(x))\psi(x) = 0$$

(2.13)

where E is the total energy of the particle. If E is finite, the wave function must be zero, or $$\psi(x) = 0,$$ in both regions I and III. A particle cannot penetrate these infinite potential barriers, so the probability of finding the particle in regions I and III is zero.

The time-independent Schrodinger's wave equation in region II, where V = 0, becomes

$$\frac{\partial^2\psi(x)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}\psi(x) = 0$$

### Instruction:
Solve the following question:
Building off of our discussion in lecture about the "particle in an infinite potential well," consider a particle in a finite potential well between 00 and aa in 1-dimension. The potential energy is finite (V0)(V0​) outside of the box and 00 within the box. Beginning with the time-independent Schrödinger equation, complete the following parts: (30 points)

a) Set up the set of wave function equations for the three distinct regions in xx (these can include unknown constants).

b) What are the boundary conditions (hint: wave function and its first derivative must be continuous)?

c) Applying the boundary conditions, determine the expression that describes how the wave number is constrained in order to yield solutions to the wave equation (hint: the answer should be an equation in the form tan⁡(ka)=(some function of k,E, etc.)tan(ka)=(some function of k,E, etc.)).

d) Conceptualization: Disregarding the equations and analysis from parts a-c), sketch the wave function at the first three energy levels within this finite potential well and on the same plot, sketch the wave functions for if the well were an infinite potential well. How are the wave functions qualitatively different?
By doing the following:
First, reflect on the question (without actually solving it or doing any math) and the context shown above and determine the correct approach/strategy to solving it.
Then, solve the question step by step. If you ever need to solve an equation or calculate the value of an expression, utilize function calling by writing sympy code. But before writing code, plan out what variables will be used and what equations/expressions will be solved, and what should be printed out.
When writing your code block, make sure to define all variables used and use print statements as variables won't be displayed automatically, ie, write ``print(solution)`` instead of ``solution``.
After you output code, I will go and run the code and report whatever is printed to console, like this:
```output
5```
Reflect upon the results and see if they make sense, and continue with the next step as needed. If there is an error, analyze the code and the error and think of ways to fix the error. Then output new code. If you fail to fix the error, think of an alternative way to solve the problem.
Note that after I run the code, I will wipe the memory. Therefor, previously defined symbols and variables will be erased and must be redefined in the next code block you write. For instance, if you found that m=5 in the last code block, you must redefine m=5 in the new code block you write.
Finally, after solving the problem, output "Answer:", followed by the answer.
