To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Given Information**:
   - For part (a): Wavelength of green light, \( \lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} = 550 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).
   - For part (b): Wavelength of blue light, \( \lambda = 440 \, \text{nm} = 440 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).
   - Mass of the electron, \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \).

2. **Formulate the Equations**:
   - The de Broglie wavelength equation relates wavelength and momentum:
     \[
     \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
     \]
   - The momentum of the electron can be expressed as:
     \[
     p = mv
     \]
   - The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:
     \[
     KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
     \]

3. **Determine the Steps to Solve**:
   - For part (a):
     - Calculate the momentum using \( p = \frac{h}{\lambda} \).
     - Calculate the velocity using \( v = \frac{p}{m} \).
   - For part (b):
     - Repeat the same calculations with the new wavelength.
   - For both parts, compare the momentum of the photon (calculated from \( p = \frac{h}{\lambda} \)) with the momentum of the electron.

4. **Plan the Variables**:
   - Define constants: Planck's constant \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).
   - For each part, calculate:
     - \( \lambda \)
     - \( p \) (momentum)
     - \( v \) (velocity)

Now, let's implement the calculations in code. 

### Code Block:
```python
import sympy as sp

# Constants
h = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s
m = 9.11e-31   # Mass of electron in kg

# Wavelengths in meters
lambda_green = 550e-9  # 550 nm
lambda_blue = 440e-9   # 440 nm

# Part (a) - Green light
p_green = h / lambda_green  # momentum of electron
v_green = p_green / m       # velocity of electron

# Part (b) - Blue light
p_blue = h / lambda_blue    # momentum of electron
v_blue = p_blue / m         # velocity of electron

# Output results
print("Green light:")
print("Momentum (p):", p_green)
print("Velocity (v):", v_green)

print("\nBlue light:")
print("Momentum (p):", p_blue)
print("Velocity (v):", v_blue)
```
```output
Green light:
Momentum (p): 1.2047272727272726e-27
Velocity (v): 1322.4229118850412

Blue light:
Momentum (p): 1.5059090909090909e-27
Velocity (v): 1653.0286398563017
```
The results from the calculations are as follows:

### For Green Light (λ = 550 nm):
- **Momentum (p)**: \( 1.2047 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
- **Velocity (v)**: \( 1322.42 \, \text{m/s} \)

### For Blue Light (λ = 440 nm):
- **Momentum (p)**: \( 1.5059 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
- **Velocity (v)**: \( 1653.03 \, \text{m/s} \)

Next, we need to compare the momentum of the electron with the momentum of the corresponding photon for both wavelengths.

### Photon Momentum Calculation:
The momentum of a photon is given by:
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{h}{\lambda}
\]

We will calculate the momentum of the photon for both wavelengths and then compare it with the momentum of the electron.

### Code Block for Photon Momentum:
```python
# Calculate photon momentum for both wavelengths
p_photon_green = h / lambda_green  # momentum of photon for green light
p_photon_blue = h / lambda_blue    # momentum of photon for blue light

# Output results
print("Photon Momentum for Green Light (p):", p_photon_green)
print("Photon Momentum for Blue Light (p):", p_photon_blue)

# Compare photon momentum with electron momentum
print("\nComparison:")
print("Green Light - Electron Momentum:", p_green, "Photon Momentum:", p_photon_green)
print("Blue Light - Electron Momentum:", p_blue, "Photon Momentum:", p_photon_blue)
``````

It seems that the variables were not defined in the current context because the previous code block was executed in a different environment. We need to redefine all necessary variables before performing the calculations for the photon momentum.

Let's redefine the constants and variables, then calculate the photon momentum for both wavelengths and compare it with the electron momentum.

### Code Block:
```python
import sympy as sp

# Redefine constants
h = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in J·s
m = 9.11e-31   # Mass of electron in kg

# Wavelengths in meters
lambda_green = 550e-9  # 550 nm
lambda_blue = 440e-9   # 440 nm

# Calculate photon momentum for both wavelengths
p_photon_green = h / lambda_green  # momentum of photon for green light
p_photon_blue = h / lambda_blue    # momentum of photon for blue light

# Calculate electron momentum from previous results
p_green = h / lambda_green  # momentum of electron for green light
p_blue = h / lambda_blue    # momentum of electron for blue light

# Output results
print("Photon Momentum for Green Light (p):", p_photon_green)
print("Photon Momentum for Blue Light (p):", p_photon_blue)

# Compare photon momentum with electron momentum
print("\nComparison:")
print("Green Light - Electron Momentum:", p_green, "Photon Momentum:", p_photon_green)
print("Blue Light - Electron Momentum:", p_blue, "Photon Momentum:", p_photon_blue)

```output
Photon Momentum for Green Light (p): 1.2047272727272726e-27
Photon Momentum for Blue Light (p): 1.5059090909090909e-27

Comparison:
Green Light - Electron Momentum: 1.2047272727272726e-27 Photon Momentum: 1.2047272727272726e-27
Blue Light - Electron Momentum: 1.5059090909090909e-27 Photon Momentum: 1.5059090909090909e-27
```
The results indicate that the momentum of the electron is equal to the momentum of the corresponding photon for both wavelengths:

### For Green Light (λ = 550 nm):
- **Electron Momentum**: \( 1.2047 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
- **Photon Momentum**: \( 1.2047 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)

### For Blue Light (λ = 440 nm):
- **Electron Momentum**: \( 1.5059 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)
- **Photon Momentum**: \( 1.5059 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)

### Conclusion:
- The momentum of the electron is equal to the momentum of the photon for both the green and blue light wavelengths. This demonstrates the wave-particle duality principle, where both particles (electrons) and waves (photons) can exhibit similar momentum characteristics when their wavelengths are matched.

### Final Answer:
- For both parts (a) and (b), the momentum of the photon is equal to the momentum of the electron. 

Answer: The momentum of the photon is equal to the momentum of the electron for both wavelengths.
